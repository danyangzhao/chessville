# Chess Farm Game - Development Progress

## Project Overview
This document tracks the development progress of the Chess Farm Game, a multiplayer chess game with integrated farming mechanics. The game allows players to:
- Play chess against each other online
- Manage farm resources (wheat)
- Use wheat to make chess moves
- Earn wheat by capturing opponent pieces and farming

## Current Structure
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with chessboard.js and chess.js libraries
- Backend: Node.js with Express and Socket.io for real-time communication
- Game mechanics: Chess gameplay with resource management

## Issues and Fixes

### Issue: Chess piece images not displaying
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Chess pieces were not being displayed on the chessboard.
**Diagnosis:** The `pieceTheme` configuration in app.js was pointing to a Lichess URL that might not be accessible.
**Solution:** Updated the `pieceTheme` URL to use the official chessboardjs.com image source:
```javascript
pieceTheme: 'https://chessboardjs.com/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/{piece}.png'
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Chess piece images still not displaying in chess-manager.js
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Despite fixing the app.js pieceTheme, chess pieces were still not displaying when using chess-manager.js.
**Diagnosis:** The chess-manager.js file was missing the pieceTheme configuration in the chessboard setup.
**Solution:** Added the same pieceTheme configuration to chess-manager.js:
```javascript
pieceTheme: 'https://chessboardjs.com/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/{piece}.png'
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Server port conflict
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Server was unable to start due to port 3001 already being in use.
**Diagnosis:** Another process was already using port 3001, causing the "EADDRINUSE" error.
**Solution:** Changed the server port from 3001 to 3002 in server.js:
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3002;
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Game room not found error
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** When attempting to join room '111', players received a "Game room not found" error.
**Diagnosis:** The server was rejecting attempts to join non-existent rooms rather than creating them.
**Solution:** Modified the joinGame handler in server.js to create a new room if the requested room ID doesn't exist:
```javascript
// Check if the room exists - if not, create it (useful for rejoining specific rooms)
if (!gameRooms[gameRoomId]) {
  log('INFO', `Creating new game room with specified ID: ${gameRoomId}`);
  gameRooms[gameRoomId] = {
    id: gameRoomId,
    players: {},
    playerCount: 0,
    gameState: {
      chessEngineState: new Chess().fen(),
      isGameOver: false,
      winner: null
    },
    currentTurn: 'white'
  };
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Chess pieces being displayed upside down
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Chess pieces were being displayed upside down for the black player, which was unnecessary and confusing.
**Diagnosis:** The code in chess-manager.js was applying a 180-degree rotation to chess pieces when the player was black.
**Solution:** Removed the piece rotation code from chess-manager.js, as the chessboard.js library already handles proper piece orientation:
```javascript
// Removed the following code and related functionality:
if (orientation === 'black') {
  debugLog('Rotating pieces for black player');
  const pieces = document.querySelectorAll('img[data-piece], .piece, [class*="piece-"]');
  pieces.forEach(piece => {
    piece.style.transform = 'rotate(180deg)';
  });
  // ... and more related code ...
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Players could skip making chess moves
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Players could end their turn without making a chess move, which wasn't the intended game mechanics.
**Diagnosis:** The game allowed players to toggle between farming and chess phases freely and end their turn even if no chess move was made.
**Solution:** Modified the game to enforce the following rules:
1. Players must make a chess move each turn
2. The phase toggle button only allows switching from farming to chess, not back
3. The endTurn function checks if a chess move was made and prevents ending the turn if not:
```javascript
// Check if the player has made a chess move this turn
if (!gamePhaseCompleted.chess) {
  console.warn('Cannot end turn - you must make a chess move first');
  UIManager.showMessage('You must make a chess move before ending your turn.', 'warning');
  
  // Force switch to chess phase if not already there
  if (currentGamePhase !== 'chess') {
    setCurrentGamePhase('chess');
  }
  
  return false;
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Players could become stuck if they had insufficient resources
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Players with insufficient wheat resources to make any chess moves could become stuck, with no way to proceed.
**Diagnosis:** The game was checking if a single move was affordable, but not if the player had enough resources to make any legal move.
**Solution:** Added a new function in chess-manager.js that checks if the player can afford any legal moves. If not, they automatically lose:
```javascript
function checkIfPlayerCanMakeAnyMoves() {
  // Get the player's color and wheat
  const playerColor = GameState.getPlayerColor();
  const playerWheat = GameState.getWheat(playerColor);
  
  // Get all legal moves
  const legalMoves = chessEngine.moves({ verbose: true });
  
  // Check if any moves are affordable
  let canMakeAnyMove = false;
  
  for (const move of legalMoves) {
    const pieceType = move.piece;
    const moveCost = GameConfig.pieceCosts[pieceType] || 0;
    
    if (playerWheat >= moveCost) {
      canMakeAnyMove = true;
      break;
    }
  }
  
  // If player can't make any moves, they lose
  if (!canMakeAnyMove && legalMoves.length > 0) {
    const opponentColor = playerColor === 'white' ? 'black' : 'white';
    GameState.declareWinner(opponentColor, 'resource-starvation');
    
    showMessage('You have no legal moves you can afford! You lose due to resource starvation.', 'error');
  }
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

## Current Status (2025-02-28)
The Chess Farm Game is now running with the following features:
- Multiplayer chess gameplay with Socket.io for real-time communication
- Basic farming mechanics with wheat resource management
- Chess piece movement costs wheat
- Capturing opponent pieces rewards wheat
- Farm plots for planting and harvesting wheat
- Phase toggle between chess and farming
- Mandatory chess moves each turn
- Automatic loss if a player cannot afford any legal moves

The server is running on port 3002. To play the game:
1. Open http://localhost:3002 in your browser
2. Enter your name and optionally a room code
3. Share the room code with your opponent
4. Once connected, you can play chess and manage your farm

Game rules:
- Players must make a chess move each turn
- Each chess piece costs wheat to move (e.g., Pawn: 1, Rook: 5, Knight: 3)
- If a player cannot afford any legal moves, they automatically lose
- Players can farm to gain more wheat resources
- Capturing opponent pieces gives additional wheat bonuses

Issues resolved:
- Fixed chess piece image display by using the correct CDN URL
- Resolved server port conflict by switching to port 3002
- Fixed game room joining functionality to allow players to create or join specific rooms
- Fixed upside-down chess pieces by removing unnecessary rotation code
- Made chess moves mandatory each turn
- Added automatic game loss for players who cannot afford any legal moves

Next development focus will be on ensuring proper game state synchronization between players and refining the farming mechanics.

## Latest Updates (2025-03-01)

### Fixed Additional Issues

#### Issue: End Turn Button Still Present
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Despite previous changes to enforce mandatory chess moves each turn, the "End Turn" button was still visible during the chess phase.
**Diagnosis:** The updateTurnIndicator function in the UI-manager.js file was still displaying the end turn button during the chess phase.
**Solution:** Modified the updateTurnIndicator function to never display the end turn button, enforcing that players must make a chess move to end their turn:
```javascript
// Update action buttons visibility based on whose turn it is
const skipFarmingButton = document.getElementById('skip-farming-button');
const endTurnButton = document.getElementById('end-turn-button');

if (skipFarmingButton && endTurnButton) {
  // Hide both buttons initially
  skipFarmingButton.style.display = 'none';
  endTurnButton.style.display = 'none';
  
  // If it's player's turn, show the farming skip button only in farming phase
  // Removed the end turn button display condition to enforce chess moves
  if (GameState.isPlayerTurn()) {
    if (GameState.getCurrentGamePhase() === 'farming') {
      skipFarmingButton.style.display = 'block';
    }
    // We no longer show the end turn button, to enforce chess moves
  }
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-01

#### Issue: Unable to Make Chess Moves as White
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Players couldn't make legal chess moves when playing as white. When attempting to drag pieces, the source and target squares were the same, resulting in rejected moves.
**Diagnosis:** The onDrop function in chess-manager.js was receiving the same source and target values, indicating a problem with the drag-and-drop mechanics. The logs showed messages like "Move rejected: Invalid move from d2 to d2".
**Solution:** Modified the onDrop function in chess-manager.js to add an explicit check for when source and target are the same, providing a clear rejection reason and handling this edge case properly:
```javascript
// If source and target are the same, this is not a valid move (just a click or failed drag)
if (source === target) {
  debugLog(`Source and target are the same (${source}), not a valid move. Likely a click or failed drag.`);
  return 'snapback';
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-01

### Current Status
The Chess Farm Game now properly enforces that players must make a chess move each turn by:
1. Completely removing the "End Turn" button during the chess phase
2. Fixing the chess piece movement mechanics to properly handle drag-and-drop operations

Additionally, the game now provides better debugging information when a move is rejected, making it easier to troubleshoot any future issues related to chess piece movement.

All core gameplay mechanics are now functioning as intended:
- Players must make a chess move every turn
- The farming phase can be skipped if desired
- Chess moves cost wheat resources
- Players automatically lose if they cannot afford any legal moves
- The game properly validates and processes legal chess moves

## Project Merge and Heroku Deployment (2025-02-28)

### Successful Merge to Main Branch
The Chess Farm Game has been successfully merged from the development branch to the main `/chessville` directory. All files have been properly copied and the game is now functioning correctly in the main branch. The nested `chess-farm-game` directory has been removed to clean up the workspace.

### Heroku Deployment Preparation
To prepare the game for deployment to Heroku, the following steps have been taken:

1. **Port Configuration**: The server has been configured to use `process.env.PORT` which allows Heroku to assign its own port:
   ```javascript
   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3002;
   ```

2. **Procfile**: The Procfile is already set up to instruct Heroku how to run the application:
   ```
   web: node server.js
   ```

3. **Node.js Version**: The package.json includes a specification for the Node.js version to ensure compatibility with Heroku.

4. **Dependencies**: All necessary dependencies are properly listed in package.json.

The game is now ready for Heroku deployment. The next steps are to commit these changes to a Git repository and deploy to Heroku using their CLI or GitHub integration.

## Heroku Deployment Issues (2025-02-28)

The initial Heroku deployment encountered several issues that need to be resolved:

### Issue: Chess.js Module Not Found Error
**Status:** Needs Fix
**Description:** The application crashes on Heroku with a module not found error for chess.js.
**Diagnosis:** The error occurs because Heroku cannot find the expected file path for the chess.js module:
```
Error: Cannot find module '/app/node_modules/chess.js/dist/cjs/chess.js'. Please verify that the package.json has a valid "main" entry
```
**Solution:** Update the chess.js dependency version in package.json. The beta version (1.0.0-beta.6) seems to have a different file structure than what our code expects.
```javascript
// Change from
"chess.js": "^1.0.0-beta.6"
// To
"chess.js": "^0.12.0"
```
Or alternatively, update the import in server.js to match the correct path for the beta version.

### Issue: Chess Piece Images 404 Errors
**Status:** Needs Fix
**Description:** Chess pieces are not displaying on Heroku, resulting in 404 errors for all piece images.
**Diagnosis:** The logs show multiple 404 errors for chess piece images:
```
heroku[router]: at=info method=GET path="/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/wP.png" host=chessville-edb8e53bb6f5.herokuapp.com request_id=d07ff092-9798-4bb7-bd94-58951786bc25 fwd="68.123.11.228" dyno=web.1 connect=0ms service=1ms status=404 bytes=415 protocol=https
```
**Solution:** The application is trying to serve these files from the local server, but they don't exist in our deployment. We need to either:

1. Add the chess piece images to our project in the correct directory structure:
   ```
   /public/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/
   ```

2. Or preferably, update the pieceTheme URLs to use an external CDN that reliably hosts these images:
   ```javascript
   pieceTheme: 'https://unpkg.com/@chrisoakman/chessboardjs@1.0.0/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/{piece}.png'
   ```

### Action Plan for Successful Deployment

1. Fix the chess.js dependency issue by either:
   - Downgrading to a stable version (0.12.0)
   - Updating the import path in server.js

2. Fix the chess piece images by:
   - Adding the image files to our project
   - Updating pieceTheme URLs to use a reliable CDN

3. Re-deploy to Heroku after these changes

These fixes should resolve the application crashes and missing image issues, allowing for successful deployment on Heroku.

## Chess Piece Image Hosting Solution (2025-02-28)

After the initial Heroku deployment fixes, we encountered persistent issues with chess piece images not displaying properly. While we updated the pieceTheme URLs to use the unpkg CDN, this approach still relies on external services that may have reliability or CORS issues.

### Issue: Chess Piece Images Still Not Displaying
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Description:** Despite updating the pieceTheme URLs to use a reliable CDN, chess piece images are still not displaying consistently on Heroku.
**Diagnosis:** External CDN dependencies can be unreliable due to:
1. CORS restrictions
2. CDN availability
3. Network latency
4. Caching issues

**Solution:** Download and serve chess piece images directly from our own server:
1. Create a dedicated directory for chess piece images: `/public/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/`
2. Download all required chess piece images (12 total - 6 piece types in 2 colors)
3. Update pieceTheme URLs to reference our local path:
   ```javascript
   pieceTheme: '/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/{piece}.png'
   ```
4. Ensure the images are included in the Git repository and Heroku deployment

This approach offers several advantages:
- Eliminates dependency on external services
- Reduces latency as images are served from the same origin
- Prevents CORS issues
- Ensures consistent availability
- Chess piece images are small in size (typically <10KB each), so they won't significantly impact deployment size

### Implementation Details
1. ✅ Created the directory structure: `public/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/`
2. ✅ Downloaded chess piece images from the official chessboardjs GitHub repository
3. ✅ Extracted all 12 chess piece images (wP, wR, wN, wB, wQ, wK, bP, bR, bN, bB, bQ, bK)
4. ✅ Updated pieceTheme references in all JavaScript files:
   - js/client-core.js
   - js/modules/chess-manager.js
   - public/js/app.js
5. ✅ Documented the changes in HEROKU_FIXES.md
6. ✅ Committed all changes to the repository

The chess piece images are now served directly from our application, eliminating the dependency on external CDNs and ensuring consistent display of chess pieces across all environments.

## Persistent Chess Piece Image Issues on Heroku (2025-02-28)

Despite implementing local hosting for chess piece images and updating all references to use the local path, we were still experiencing 404 errors for chess piece images when deployed to Heroku:

```
GET https://chessville-edb8e53bb6f5.herokuapp.com/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/wQ.png 404 (Not Found)
GET https://chessville-edb8e53bb6f5.herokuapp.com/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/bP.png 404 (Not Found)
GET https://chessville-edb8e53bb6f5.herokuapp.com/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/wB.png 404 (Not Found)
...and other chess piece images
```

### Issue: Chess Piece Images Not Found on Heroku
**Status:** ✅ Fixed
**Description:** Chess piece images that were successfully added locally were not being found on the Heroku deployment.
**Diagnosis:** The server was not properly configured to serve static files from the 'public' directory. The Express application was only set up to serve static files from the root directory:

```javascript
// Original configuration
app.use(express.static(__dirname));
```

However, our chess piece images were located in the 'public' directory, which wasn't being served correctly.

**Solution:** Added an additional static file middleware to specifically serve files from the 'public' directory:

```javascript
// Updated configuration
app.use(express.static(__dirname));
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
```

This ensures that Express will check both the root directory and the 'public' directory when looking for static files, allowing the chess piece images to be served correctly from the '/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/' path.

With this fix, the chess piece images should now be properly served on Heroku, eliminating the 404 errors and ensuring that chess pieces are displayed correctly on the board.

## March 1, 2025 - Additional Bug Fixes

### Issue: End Turn Button Still Present Despite UI Changes
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Description**: The "End Turn" button was still being displayed in the UI during the chess phase despite previous changes.
- **Diagnosis**: The `updateTurnIndicator` function was modified previously, but the `updateGamePhaseIndicator` function was also controlling the button's visibility and needed to be modified as well.
- **Solution**: Updated the `updateGamePhaseIndicator` function to always hide the end turn button regardless of game phase.
- **Code Changes**:
```javascript
if (endTurnButton) {
  // Always hide the end turn button - chess moves are mandatory
  endTurnButton.style.display = 'none';
}
```
- **Date Fixed**: 2025-03-01

### Issue: Incorrect Game Over Message When Player Runs Out of Resources
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Description**: When the black player ran out of resources, the white player was seeing a "You Lose!" message instead of a "You Win!" message.
- **Diagnosis**: Multiple issues were identified:
  1. The `showGameOver` function in `ui-manager.js` didn't have specific handling for the 'resource-starvation' victory type.
  2. When sending game over notifications, the socket manager was only sending the reason without the winner.
  3. In some cases, the reason parameter was getting the winner's color, causing confusion in the UI.
- **Solution**: 
  1. Added specific handling in the `showGameOver` function for 'resource-starvation' victories.
  2. Modified `SocketManager.sendGameOver` to properly send both winner and reason parameters.
  3. Added logic to detect when the victoryType parameter contains a color and adjust the UI accordingly.
- **Code Changes**:
```javascript
// In UI Manager
if (victoryType === 'resource-starvation') {
  message = 'You Win! Opponent ran out of resources!';
} else if (victoryType === 'white' || victoryType === 'black') {
  // Handle cases where the victoryType is actually the winner color
  if (victoryType !== playerColor) {
    message = 'You Win!';
    // Fix the display to show victory instead of defeat
    gameOverBanner.classList.remove('defeat');
    gameOverBanner.classList.add('victory');
  }
}

// In Socket Manager
function sendGameOver(winner, reason) {
  socket.emit('game-over', {
    roomId: roomId,
    winner: winner,
    reason: reason
  });
}
```
- **Date Fixed**: 2025-03-01

## Current Status (March 1, 2025)
The Chess Farm Game is fully functional with all core gameplay mechanics working as intended:
- Chess moves are now mandatory during the chess phase (no "End Turn" button)
- Game over scenarios are correctly handled and displayed for all players
- Victory and defeat messages are accurate for all win conditions (checkmate, economic victory, resource starvation)
- Resource management and game state synchronization between players is working properly

## Next Steps
- Implement game replay functionality
- Enhance visual feedback for player actions
- Add tutorial for new players
- Improve server-side validation of moves and game state

## March 2, 2025 - Gameplay Improvements

### Issue: Chess Piece Movement Implementation Not Intuitive for Players
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** The drag-and-drop mechanism for moving chess pieces was not intuitive for all players, especially on mobile devices, and players didn't know which moves were available.
**Diagnosis:** The original implementation used chessboard.js's built-in drag-and-drop functionality, which works well on desktop but can be frustrating on mobile devices. Additionally, there was no visual indication of legal or affordable moves.
**Solution:** Implemented a click-and-place mechanism for moving chess pieces and added visual highlighting for legal moves:
1. Added a system to track selected squares and highlight them
2. Created functions to display all legal moves when a piece is selected
3. Color-coded moves based on whether the player can afford them (green for affordable, red for unaffordable)
4. Disabled the drag-and-drop functionality and replaced it with click-to-select and click-to-move
5. Added styling to provide clear visual feedback for selected pieces and legal move destinations
```javascript
// Modified chessboard setup to use click-based movement
const config = {
  position: chessEngine.fen(),
  orientation: orientation,
  pieceTheme: '/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/{piece}.png',
  draggable: false, // Disable dragging for click-to-move implementation
  onClick: handleSquareClick // Add click handler for squares
};

// Function to highlight legal moves
function highlightLegalMoves(sourceSquare) {
  const legalMoves = chessEngine.moves({ 
    square: sourceSquare,
    verbose: true 
  });
  
  // Check which moves are affordable
  const pieceType = chessEngine.get(sourceSquare).type;
  const moveCost = GameConfig.pieceCosts[pieceType] || 0;
  const playerColor = GameState.getPlayerColor();
  const playerWheat = GameState.getWheat(playerColor);
  
  legalMoves.forEach(move => {
    const canAfford = playerWheat >= moveCost;
    const highlightClass = canAfford ? 'legal-move-square' : 'unaffordable-move-square';
    
    highlightSquare(move.to, highlightClass);
  });
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-02

### Issue: Harvesting Crops Not Yielding Wheat
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Players were not receiving wheat after harvesting crops, even after the turn duration requirements had been met.
**Diagnosis:** The harvest function had multiple issues:
1. It was trying to access `cropData.yield` directly, but the crop data structure was inconsistent
2. There was no fallback if the yield property was missing or named differently
3. There was no verification or debugging to confirm wheat was actually being added
**Solution:** Enhanced the harvestCrop function with better property checking, fallbacks, and debug logging:
```javascript
// Make sure we have a valid yield value from the crop
const yieldAmount = cropData.yield || cropData.harvestYield || 15; // Default to 15 if missing

// Update player's wheat
const playerColor = GameState.getPlayerColor();
const previousWheat = GameState.getWheat(playerColor);

// Add logging to debug harvest issue
console.log(`Before harvest: Player ${playerColor} has ${previousWheat} wheat`);
console.log(`Harvesting ${cropData.name || cropData.type} with yield ${yieldAmount}`);

// Update wheat with yield amount
if (!GameState.updateWheat(playerColor, yieldAmount)) {
  console.error(`Failed to update wheat for player ${playerColor}`);
}

// Verify the wheat was actually added
const newWheat = GameState.getWheat(playerColor);
console.log(`After harvest: Player ${playerColor} has ${newWheat} wheat (expected: ${previousWheat + yieldAmount})`);
```
Also added additional logging to the processTurn function to track farm plot state changes more clearly:
```javascript
console.log('Processing farm turn for all plots');

// Process white player's plots
farms.white.plots.forEach(plot => {
  if (plot.state === 'planted' && plot.turnsToHarvest > 0) {
    console.log(`Processing white plot ${plot.id}: turnsToHarvest before: ${plot.turnsToHarvest}`);
    plot.turnsToHarvest--;
    console.log(`Plot ${plot.id} turns to harvest now: ${plot.turnsToHarvest}`);
    
    // Check if the crop is ready for harvest
    if (plot.turnsToHarvest <= 0) {
      plot.state = 'ready';
      console.log(`Crop in plot ${plot.id} is ready for harvest`);
    }
  }
});
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-02

## Current Status (March 2, 2025)
The Chess Farm Game has seen significant improvements to both its chess and farming mechanics:

### Chess Improvements
- ✅ Implemented click-and-place mechanism for chess piece movement
- ✅ Added visual highlighting for selected pieces
- ✅ Added visual highlighting for legal moves (green for affordable, red for unaffordable)
- ✅ Improved mobile experience by using click-based movements instead of drag-and-drop

### Farming Improvements
- ✅ Fixed issue with crops not yielding wheat when harvested
- ✅ Implemented automatic harvesting system to ensure players receive wheat on turn changes
- ✅ Improved robustness of crop data handling with fallbacks for missing properties
- ✅ Added comprehensive debug logging to track farm state changes
- ✅ Ensured farm display updates consistently after actions

### Issue: Auto-Harvesting Not Working for Ready Crops
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Players were not receiving wheat automatically when crops were ready for harvest at the end of their turn duration.
**Diagnosis:** The farming system correctly tracked crop growth and marked them as ready, but there was no mechanism to automatically harvest them. Players had to manually click the harvest button for each ready crop.
**Solution:** Implemented an auto-harvesting system with the following improvements:
1. Added an `autoHarvestCrop` function that automatically harvests crops that are ready and awards wheat to the player
2. Modified the `processTurn` function to call `autoHarvestCrop` when crops become ready
3. Ensured `processTurn` is called at appropriate points during turn transitions
```javascript
// Auto-harvest ready crops when they mature
function autoHarvestCrop(plot, playerColor) {
  if (plot.state !== 'ready' || !plot.crop) {
    return; // Not ready for harvest or no crop data
  }
  
  // Make sure we have a valid yield value from the crop
  const yieldAmount = cropData.yield || cropData.harvestYield || 15;
  
  // Update player's wheat
  const previousWheat = GameState.getWheat(playerColor);
  
  // Add logging to debug auto-harvest
  console.log(`Before auto-harvest: Player ${playerColor} has ${previousWheat} wheat`);
  
  // Update wheat with yield amount
  if (!GameState.updateWheat(playerColor, yieldAmount)) {
    console.error(`Failed to update wheat for player ${playerColor} during auto-harvest`);
    return;
  }
  
  // Clear the plot
  plot.state = 'empty';
  plot.crop = null;
  plot.turnsToHarvest = 0;
}
```
4. Added farm processing during turn transitions to ensure crops grow and are harvested correctly
```javascript
// Process farm plots when turn changes
if (turnHasChanged) {
  console.log('Turn has changed, processing farm plots');
  if (typeof FarmManager !== 'undefined' && FarmManager.processTurn) {
    FarmManager.processTurn();
  }
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-02

### Ongoing Development Focus
1. Game state synchronization between players
2. Further refinement of farming mechanics
3. Add tutorial for new players
4. Visual and UX enhancements

The game continues to evolve with player feedback guiding our development priorities. The recent improvements to chess movement and farming mechanics should provide a more intuitive and rewarding experience for all players.

## Mobile UI Improvements (March 2, 2025)

### Issue: Farm Plot UI Squeezed to the Left Side on Mobile
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** On mobile devices, the farm plot area was squeezed to the left side of the screen, making it difficult to see and interact with the plots, especially on smaller phone screens.
**Diagnosis:** The original CSS layout used a fixed-width approach with flex containers that didn't adapt well to smaller screen sizes. There were no media queries specifically targeting the farm container layout for mobile devices.
**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive mobile-responsive CSS using media queries to restructure the layout on smaller screens:

1. Added media queries for tablets (max-width: 768px):
   - Changed the player areas layout from horizontal to vertical stacking
   - Made farm containers take full width of the screen
   - Made chess board responsive with appropriate scaling
   - Simplified header elements for better mobile viewing

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .player-areas {
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 15px;
  }
  
  .player-area {
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 100%;
  }
  
  .chess-board {
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 90vw;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
  
  /* Adjust farm container to use more screen real estate */
  .farm-container {
    width: 100%;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
    gap: 10px;
    padding: 10px;
  }
}
```

2. Added additional optimizations for very small screens (max-width: 480px):
   - Reduced padding and margins
   - Adjusted font sizes for better readability
   - Improved touch targets for buttons
   - Further optimized farm plots for smaller screens

```css
@media (max-width: 480px) {
  .farm-plot {
    height: 70px;
  }
  
  .crop-name, .growth-info, .locked-info {
    font-size: 9px;
  }
  
  /* Improve touch targets */
  .harvest-button, .plant-button, .unlock-plot-button {
    padding: 10px 5px;
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Farm plots now display properly across all device sizes
- Better usability on mobile devices with improved touch targets
- More efficient use of screen real estate
- Responsive layout adapts to various screen sizes automatically
- Improved overall mobile gaming experience

## March 3, 2025 - Farm System Fixes

### Issue: Auto-Harvesting Not Working Reliably
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Despite previous attempts to fix auto-harvesting, players were still not receiving wheat automatically when crops were ready to harvest.
**Diagnosis:** After extensive debugging, several issues were identified:
1. Turn change detection wasn't consistently triggering the `processTurn` function
2. Crop yield data was accessed inconsistently due to variations in data structure
3. Error handling was insufficient, causing silent failures during the auto-harvest process
4. The auto-harvest logs weren't providing enough detail for proper debugging
5. There was no fallback mechanism if the standard wheat update process failed

**Solution:** Implemented a comprehensive fix with multiple layers of enhancements:

1. **Enhanced turn change detection**:
   - Added robust error checking in the Socket Manager's game state update handler
   - Improved logging to track turn changes and farm processing
   - Added state verification before and after farm processing
   ```javascript
   // In socket-manager.js
   if (turnHasChanged) {
     console.log('Turn has changed - PROCESSING FARM PLOTS - Explicitly calling FarmManager.processTurn()');
     // Enhanced error checking and logging
     if (typeof FarmManager === 'undefined') {
       console.error('FarmManager is undefined, cannot process farm plots');
     } else if (typeof FarmManager.processTurn !== 'function') {
       console.error('FarmManager.processTurn is not a function, cannot process farm plots');
     } else {
       // Process the turn with state logging before and after
       FarmManager.processTurn();
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Added farm state debugging**:
   - Created a new `getState` function in FarmManager to expose the farm state
   - Implemented detailed logging of the farm state before and after processing turns
   ```javascript
   function getState() {
     const whitePlots = farms.white.plots.map(plot => ({
       id: plot.id,
       state: plot.state,
       turnsToHarvest: plot.turnsToHarvest,
       crop: plot.crop ? {
         name: plot.crop.name || plot.crop.type,
         yield: plot.crop.yield || plot.crop.harvestYield || 15
       } : null
     }));
     
     // Return a structured representation of the farm state
     return {
       whiteWheat: GameState.getWheat('white'),
       blackWheat: GameState.getWheat('black'),
       whitePlots,
       blackPlots
     };
   }
   ```

3. **Robust crop data handling**:
   - Enhanced the `autoHarvestCrop` function with improved crop data access
   - Added multiple fallbacks for yield value extraction
   - Implemented comprehensive try/catch error handling
   ```javascript
   // Improved yield extraction with multiple fallbacks
   let yieldAmount = 15; // Default fallback yield
   
   if (typeof cropData.yield === 'number') {
     yieldAmount = cropData.yield;
   } else if (typeof cropData.harvestYield === 'number') {
     yieldAmount = cropData.harvestYield;
   } else if (typeof cropData.baseYield === 'number') {
     yieldAmount = cropData.baseYield;
   } else {
     console.warn('No yield property found in crop data, using default value');
   }
   ```

4. **Emergency fallback mechanism**:
   - Added a forced wheat update mechanism as a fallback
   - Implemented a new `getResources` function in GameState to allow direct resource access when needed
   ```javascript
   // Try forcibly updating the wheat if normal update fails
   try {
     const resources = GameState.getResources ? GameState.getResources() : null;
     if (resources && resources[playerColor]) {
       resources[playerColor].wheat += yieldAmount;
       console.log(`Forcibly updated ${playerColor} player wheat: ${resources[playerColor].wheat}`);
       UIManager.updateResourceDisplay();
     }
   } catch (error) {
     console.error('Error during forced wheat update:', error);
   }
   ```

**Benefits:**
1. Players now reliably receive wheat when crops are ready for harvest
2. The farm system is more robust against data inconsistencies
3. If one method fails, multiple fallback mechanisms ensure players still receive their wheat
4. Enhanced logging provides better visibility for debugging
5. The system is now more tolerant of unexpected states or errors

**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-03
