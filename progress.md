# Chess Farm Game - Development Progress

## Project Overview
This document tracks the development progress of the Chess Farm Game, a multiplayer chess game with integrated farming mechanics. The game allows players to:
- Play chess against each other online
- Manage farm resources (wheat)
- Use wheat to make chess moves
- Earn wheat by capturing opponent pieces and farming

## Current Structure
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with chessboard.js and chess.js libraries
- Backend: Node.js with Express and Socket.io for real-time communication
- Game mechanics: Chess gameplay with resource management

## Issues and Fixes

### Issue: Chess piece images not displaying
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Chess pieces were not being displayed on the chessboard.
**Diagnosis:** The `pieceTheme` configuration in app.js was pointing to a Lichess URL that might not be accessible.
**Solution:** Updated the `pieceTheme` URL to use the official chessboardjs.com image source:
```javascript
pieceTheme: 'https://chessboardjs.com/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/{piece}.png'
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Chess piece images still not displaying in chess-manager.js
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Despite fixing the app.js pieceTheme, chess pieces were still not displaying when using chess-manager.js.
**Diagnosis:** The chess-manager.js file was missing the pieceTheme configuration in the chessboard setup.
**Solution:** Added the same pieceTheme configuration to chess-manager.js:
```javascript
pieceTheme: 'https://chessboardjs.com/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/{piece}.png'
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Server port conflict
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Server was unable to start due to port 3001 already being in use.
**Diagnosis:** Another process was already using port 3001, causing the "EADDRINUSE" error.
**Solution:** Changed the server port from 3001 to 3002 in server.js:
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3002;
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Game room not found error
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** When attempting to join room '111', players received a "Game room not found" error.
**Diagnosis:** The server was rejecting attempts to join non-existent rooms rather than creating them.
**Solution:** Modified the joinGame handler in server.js to create a new room if the requested room ID doesn't exist:
```javascript
// Check if the room exists - if not, create it (useful for rejoining specific rooms)
if (!gameRooms[gameRoomId]) {
  log('INFO', `Creating new game room with specified ID: ${gameRoomId}`);
  gameRooms[gameRoomId] = {
    id: gameRoomId,
    players: {},
    playerCount: 0,
    gameState: {
      chessEngineState: new Chess().fen(),
      isGameOver: false,
      winner: null
    },
    currentTurn: 'white'
  };
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Chess pieces being displayed upside down
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Chess pieces were being displayed upside down for the black player, which was unnecessary and confusing.
**Diagnosis:** The code in chess-manager.js was applying a 180-degree rotation to chess pieces when the player was black.
**Solution:** Removed the piece rotation code from chess-manager.js, as the chessboard.js library already handles proper piece orientation:
```javascript
// Removed the following code and related functionality:
if (orientation === 'black') {
  debugLog('Rotating pieces for black player');
  const pieces = document.querySelectorAll('img[data-piece], .piece, [class*="piece-"]');
  pieces.forEach(piece => {
    piece.style.transform = 'rotate(180deg)';
  });
  // ... and more related code ...
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Players could skip making chess moves
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Players could end their turn without making a chess move, which wasn't the intended game mechanics.
**Diagnosis:** The game allowed players to toggle between farming and chess phases freely and end their turn even if no chess move was made.
**Solution:** Modified the game to enforce the following rules:
1. Players must make a chess move each turn
2. The phase toggle button only allows switching from farming to chess, not back
3. The endTurn function checks if a chess move was made and prevents ending the turn if not:
```javascript
// Check if the player has made a chess move this turn
if (!gamePhaseCompleted.chess) {
  console.warn('Cannot end turn - you must make a chess move first');
  UIManager.showMessage('You must make a chess move before ending your turn.', 'warning');
  
  // Force switch to chess phase if not already there
  if (currentGamePhase !== 'chess') {
    setCurrentGamePhase('chess');
  }
  
  return false;
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Players could become stuck if they had insufficient resources
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Players with insufficient wheat resources to make any chess moves could become stuck, with no way to proceed.
**Diagnosis:** The game was checking if a single move was affordable, but not if the player had enough resources to make any legal move.
**Solution:** Added a new function in chess-manager.js that checks if the player can afford any legal moves. If not, they automatically lose:
```javascript
function checkIfPlayerCanMakeAnyMoves() {
  // Get the player's color and wheat
  const playerColor = GameState.getPlayerColor();
  const playerWheat = GameState.getWheat(playerColor);
  
  // Get all legal moves
  const legalMoves = chessEngine.moves({ verbose: true });
  
  // Check if any moves are affordable
  let canMakeAnyMove = false;
  
  for (const move of legalMoves) {
    const pieceType = move.piece;
    const moveCost = GameConfig.pieceCosts[pieceType] || 0;
    
    if (playerWheat >= moveCost) {
      canMakeAnyMove = true;
      break;
    }
  }
  
  // If player can't make any moves, they lose
  if (!canMakeAnyMove && legalMoves.length > 0) {
    const opponentColor = playerColor === 'white' ? 'black' : 'white';
    GameState.declareWinner(opponentColor, 'resource-starvation');
    
    showMessage('You have no legal moves you can afford! You lose due to resource starvation.', 'error');
  }
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

## Current Status (2025-02-28)
The Chess Farm Game is now running with the following features:
- Multiplayer chess gameplay with Socket.io for real-time communication
- Basic farming mechanics with wheat resource management
- Chess piece movement costs wheat
- Capturing opponent pieces rewards wheat
- Farm plots for planting and harvesting wheat
- Phase toggle between chess and farming
- Mandatory chess moves each turn
- Automatic loss if a player cannot afford any legal moves

The server is running on port 3002. To play the game:
1. Open http://localhost:3002 in your browser
2. Enter your name and optionally a room code
3. Share the room code with your opponent
4. Once connected, you can play chess and manage your farm

Game rules:
- Players must make a chess move each turn
- Each chess piece costs wheat to move (e.g., Pawn: 1, Rook: 5, Knight: 3)
- If a player cannot afford any legal moves, they automatically lose
- Players can farm to gain more wheat resources
- Capturing opponent pieces gives additional wheat bonuses

Issues resolved:
- Fixed chess piece image display by using the correct CDN URL
- Resolved server port conflict by switching to port 3002
- Fixed game room joining functionality to allow players to create or join specific rooms
- Fixed upside-down chess pieces by removing unnecessary rotation code
- Made chess moves mandatory each turn
- Added automatic game loss for players who cannot afford any legal moves

Next development focus will be on ensuring proper game state synchronization between players and refining the farming mechanics.

## Latest Updates (2025-02-28)

### Successful Implementation and Testing
The game is now fully functional with all the core features working correctly. Recent testing has confirmed that:

- The server successfully starts on port 3002
- Players can join game rooms and play together
- Chess mechanics function correctly with proper turn enforcement
- Resource management (wheat) for piece movement works as intended
- The mandatory chess move requirement each turn is functioning properly
- Game loss due to insufficient resources is triggered correctly when a player cannot afford any legal moves

The server logs show successful game activity with multiple chess moves being made by both players, indicating that the synchronization between players is working correctly. The game properly records and validates moves from both players.

### Resolved Port Conflict
Previous server errors with port conflicts have been permanently resolved by:
1. Using `pkill -f "node server.js"` to ensure no lingering server processes
2. Starting the server with the correct port configuration (3002)

### Next Development Phase
With the core gameplay now stable and functional, development can proceed to:
- Enhancing the farming mechanics and economy
- Adding more visual feedback and animations
- Implementing sound effects for a better player experience
- Creating a tutorial system for new players
- Adding additional victory conditions

The Chess Farm Game is now ready to be merged back to the main branch as a solid foundation for future enhancements.

## Project Merge and Heroku Deployment (2025-02-28)

### Successful Merge to Main Branch
The Chess Farm Game has been successfully merged from the development branch to the main `/chessville` directory. All files have been properly copied and the game is now functioning correctly in the main branch. The nested `chess-farm-game` directory has been removed to clean up the workspace.

### Heroku Deployment Preparation
To prepare the game for deployment to Heroku, the following steps have been taken:

1. **Port Configuration**: The server has been configured to use `process.env.PORT` which allows Heroku to assign its own port:
   ```javascript
   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3002;
   ```

2. **Procfile**: The Procfile is already set up to instruct Heroku how to run the application:
   ```
   web: node server.js
   ```

3. **Node.js Version**: The package.json includes a specification for the Node.js version to ensure compatibility with Heroku.

4. **Dependencies**: All necessary dependencies are properly listed in package.json.

The game is now ready for Heroku deployment. The next steps are to commit these changes to a Git repository and deploy to Heroku using their CLI or GitHub integration.
