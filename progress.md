# Chess Farm Game - Development Progress

## Project Overview
This document tracks the development progress of the Chess Farm Game, a multiplayer chess game with integrated farming mechanics. The game allows players to:
- Play chess against each other online
- Manage farm resources (wheat)
- Use wheat to make chess moves
- Earn wheat by capturing opponent pieces and farming

## Current Structure
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with chessboard.js and chess.js libraries
- Backend: Node.js with Express and Socket.io for real-time communication
- Game mechanics: Chess gameplay with resource management

## Issues and Fixes

### Issue: Chess piece images not displaying
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Chess pieces were not being displayed on the chessboard.
**Diagnosis:** The `pieceTheme` configuration in app.js was pointing to a Lichess URL that might not be accessible.
**Solution:** Updated the `pieceTheme` URL to use the official chessboardjs.com image source:
```javascript
pieceTheme: 'https://chessboardjs.com/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/{piece}.png'
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Chess piece images still not displaying in chess-manager.js
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Despite fixing the app.js pieceTheme, chess pieces were still not displaying when using chess-manager.js.
**Diagnosis:** The chess-manager.js file was missing the pieceTheme configuration in the chessboard setup.
**Solution:** Added the same pieceTheme configuration to chess-manager.js:
```javascript
pieceTheme: 'https://chessboardjs.com/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/{piece}.png'
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Server port conflict
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Server was unable to start due to port 3001 already being in use.
**Diagnosis:** Another process was already using port 3001, causing the "EADDRINUSE" error.
**Solution:** Changed the server port from 3001 to 3002 in server.js:
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3002;
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Game room not found error
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** When attempting to join room '111', players received a "Game room not found" error.
**Diagnosis:** The server was rejecting attempts to join non-existent rooms rather than creating them.
**Solution:** Modified the joinGame handler in server.js to create a new room if the requested room ID doesn't exist:
```javascript
// Check if the room exists - if not, create it (useful for rejoining specific rooms)
if (!gameRooms[gameRoomId]) {
  log('INFO', `Creating new game room with specified ID: ${gameRoomId}`);
  gameRooms[gameRoomId] = {
    id: gameRoomId,
    players: {},
    playerCount: 0,
    gameState: {
      chessEngineState: new Chess().fen(),
      isGameOver: false,
      winner: null
    },
    currentTurn: 'white'
  };
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Chess pieces being displayed upside down
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Chess pieces were being displayed upside down for the black player, which was unnecessary and confusing.
**Diagnosis:** The code in chess-manager.js was applying a 180-degree rotation to chess pieces when the player was black.
**Solution:** Removed the piece rotation code from chess-manager.js, as the chessboard.js library already handles proper piece orientation:
```javascript
// Removed the following code and related functionality:
if (orientation === 'black') {
  debugLog('Rotating pieces for black player');
  const pieces = document.querySelectorAll('img[data-piece], .piece, [class*="piece-"]');
  pieces.forEach(piece => {
    piece.style.transform = 'rotate(180deg)';
  });
  // ... and more related code ...
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Players could skip making chess moves
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Players could end their turn without making a chess move, which wasn't the intended game mechanics.
**Diagnosis:** The game allowed players to toggle between farming and chess phases freely and end their turn even if no chess move was made.
**Solution:** Modified the game to enforce the following rules:
1. Players must make a chess move each turn
2. The phase toggle button only allows switching from farming to chess, not back
3. The endTurn function checks if a chess move was made and prevents ending the turn if not:
```javascript
// Check if the player has made a chess move this turn
if (!gamePhaseCompleted.chess) {
  console.warn('Cannot end turn - you must make a chess move first');
  UIManager.showMessage('You must make a chess move before ending your turn.', 'warning');
  
  // Force switch to chess phase if not already there
  if (currentGamePhase !== 'chess') {
    setCurrentGamePhase('chess');
  }
  
  return false;
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Players could become stuck if they had insufficient resources
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Players with insufficient wheat resources to make any chess moves could become stuck, with no way to proceed.
**Diagnosis:** The game was checking if a single move was affordable, but not if the player had enough resources to make any legal move.
**Solution:** Added a new function in chess-manager.js that checks if the player can afford any legal moves. If not, they automatically lose:
```javascript
function checkIfPlayerCanMakeAnyMoves() {
  // Get the player's color and wheat
  const playerColor = GameState.getPlayerColor();
  const playerWheat = GameState.getWheat(playerColor);
  
  // Get all legal moves
  const legalMoves = chessEngine.moves({ verbose: true });
  
  // Check if any moves are affordable
  let canMakeAnyMove = false;
  
  for (const move of legalMoves) {
    const pieceType = move.piece;
    const moveCost = GameConfig.pieceCosts[pieceType] || 0;
    
    if (playerWheat >= moveCost) {
      canMakeAnyMove = true;
      break;
    }
  }
  
  // If player can't make any moves, they lose
  if (!canMakeAnyMove && legalMoves.length > 0) {
    const opponentColor = playerColor === 'white' ? 'black' : 'white';
    GameState.declareWinner(opponentColor, 'resource-starvation');
    
    showMessage('You have no legal moves you can afford! You lose due to resource starvation.', 'error');
  }
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

- Automatic loss if a player cannot afford any legal moves

The server is running on port 3002. To play the game:
1. Open http://localhost:3002 in your browser
2. Enter your name and optionally a room code
3. Share the room code with your opponent
4. Once connected, you can play chess and manage your farm

Game rules:
- Players must make a chess move each turn
- Each chess piece costs wheat to move (e.g., Pawn: 1, Rook: 5, Knight: 3)
- If a player cannot afford any legal moves, they automatically lose
- Players can farm to gain more wheat resources
- Capturing opponent pieces gives additional wheat bonuses

Issues resolved:
- Fixed chess piece image display by using the correct CDN URL
- Resolved server port conflict by switching to port 3002
- Fixed game room joining functionality to allow players to create or join specific rooms
- Fixed upside-down chess pieces by removing unnecessary rotation code
- Made chess moves mandatory each turn
- Added automatic game loss for players who cannot afford any legal moves

Next development focus will be on ensuring proper game state synchronization between players and refining the farming mechanics.

## Project Merge and Heroku Deployment (2025-02-28)

### Successful Merge to Main Branch
The Chess Farm Game has been successfully merged from the development branch to the main `/chessville` directory. All files have been properly copied and the game is now functioning correctly in the main branch. The nested `chess-farm-game` directory has been removed to clean up the workspace.

### Heroku Deployment Preparation
To prepare the game for deployment to Heroku, the following steps have been taken:

1. **Port Configuration**: The server has been configured to use `process.env.PORT` which allows Heroku to assign its own port:
   ```javascript
   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3002;
   ```

2. **Procfile**: The Procfile is already set up to instruct Heroku how to run the application:
   ```
   web: node server.js
   ```

3. **Node.js Version**: The package.json includes a specification for the Node.js version to ensure compatibility with Heroku.

4. **Dependencies**: All necessary dependencies are properly listed in package.json.

The game is now ready for Heroku deployment. The next steps are to commit these changes to a Git repository and deploy to Heroku using their CLI or GitHub integration.

## Heroku Deployment Issues (2025-02-28)

The initial Heroku deployment encountered several issues that need to be resolved:

### Issue: Chess.js Module Not Found Error
**Status:** Needs Fix
**Description:** The application crashes on Heroku with a module not found error for chess.js.
**Diagnosis:** The error occurs because Heroku cannot find the expected file path for the chess.js module:
```
Error: Cannot find module '/app/node_modules/chess.js/dist/cjs/chess.js'. Please verify that the package.json has a valid "main" entry
```
**Solution:** Update the chess.js dependency version in package.json. The beta version (1.0.0-beta.6) seems to have a different file structure than what our code expects.
```javascript
// Change from
"chess.js": "^1.0.0-beta.6"
// To
"chess.js": "^0.12.0"
```
Or alternatively, update the import in server.js to match the correct path for the beta version.

### Issue: Chess Piece Images 404 Errors
**Status:** Needs Fix
**Description:** Chess pieces are not displaying on Heroku, resulting in 404 errors for all piece images.
**Diagnosis:** The logs show multiple 404 errors for chess piece images:
```
heroku[router]: at=info method=GET path="/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/wP.png" host=chessville-edb8e53bb6f5.herokuapp.com request_id=d07ff092-9798-4bb7-bd94-58951786bc25 fwd="68.123.11.228" dyno=web.1 connect=0ms service=1ms status=404 bytes=415 protocol=https
```
**Solution:** The application is trying to serve these files from the local server, but they don't exist in our deployment. We need to either:

1. Add the chess piece images to our project in the correct directory structure:
   ```
   /public/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/
   ```

2. Or preferably, update the pieceTheme URLs to use an external CDN that reliably hosts these images:
   ```javascript
   pieceTheme: 'https://unpkg.com/@chrisoakman/chessboardjs@1.0.0/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/{piece}.png'
   ```

### Action Plan for Successful Deployment

1. Fix the chess.js dependency issue by either:
   - Downgrading to a stable version (0.12.0)
   - Updating the import path in server.js

2. Fix the chess piece images by:
   - Adding the image files to our project
   - Updating pieceTheme URLs to use a reliable CDN

3. Re-deploy to Heroku after these changes

These fixes should resolve the application crashes and missing image issues, allowing for successful deployment on Heroku.

## Chess Piece Image Hosting Solution (2025-02-28)

After the initial Heroku deployment fixes, we encountered persistent issues with chess piece images not displaying properly. While we updated the pieceTheme URLs to use the unpkg CDN, this approach still relies on external services that may have reliability or CORS issues.

### Issue: Chess Piece Images Still Not Displaying
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Description:** Despite updating the pieceTheme URLs to use a reliable CDN, chess piece images are still not displaying consistently on Heroku.
**Diagnosis:** External CDN dependencies can be unreliable due to:
1. CORS restrictions
2. CDN availability
3. Network latency
4. Caching issues

**Solution:** Download and serve chess piece images directly from our own server:
1. Create a dedicated directory for chess piece images: `/public/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/`
2. Download all required chess piece images (12 total - 6 piece types in 2 colors)
3. Update pieceTheme URLs to reference our local path:
   ```javascript
   pieceTheme: '/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/{piece}.png'
   ```
4. Ensure the images are included in the Git repository and Heroku deployment

This approach offers several advantages:
- Eliminates dependency on external services
- Reduces latency as images are served from the same origin
- Prevents CORS issues
- Ensures consistent availability
- Chess piece images are small in size (typically <10KB each), so they won't significantly impact deployment size

### Implementation Details
1. ✅ Created the directory structure: `public/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/`
2. ✅ Downloaded chess piece images from the official chessboardjs GitHub repository
3. ✅ Extracted all 12 chess piece images (wP, wR, wN, wB, wQ, wK, bP, bR, bN, bB, bQ, bK)
4. ✅ Updated pieceTheme references in all JavaScript files:
   - js/client-core.js
   - js/modules/chess-manager.js
   - public/js/app.js
5. ✅ Documented the changes in HEROKU_FIXES.md
6. ✅ Committed all changes to the repository

The chess piece images are now served directly from our application, eliminating the dependency on external CDNs and ensuring consistent display of chess pieces across all environments.

## Persistent Chess Piece Image Issues on Heroku (2025-02-28)

Despite implementing local hosting for chess piece images and updating all references to use the local path, we were still experiencing 404 errors for chess piece images when deployed to Heroku:

```
GET https://chessville-edb8e53bb6f5.herokuapp.com/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/wQ.png 404 (Not Found)
GET https://chessville-edb8e53bb6f5.herokuapp.com/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/bP.png 404 (Not Found)
GET https://chessville-edb8e53bb6f5.herokuapp.com/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/wB.png 404 (Not Found)
...and other chess piece images
```

### Issue: Chess Piece Images Not Found on Heroku
**Status:** ✅ Fixed
**Description:** Chess piece images that were successfully added locally were not being found on the Heroku deployment.
**Diagnosis:** The server was not properly configured to serve static files from the 'public' directory. The Express application was only set up to serve static files from the root directory:

```javascript
// Original configuration
app.use(express.static(__dirname));
```

However, our chess piece images were located in the 'public' directory, which wasn't being served correctly.

**Solution:** Added an additional static file middleware to specifically serve files from the 'public' directory:

```javascript
// Updated configuration
app.use(express.static(__dirname));
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
```

This ensures that Express will check both the root directory and the 'public' directory when looking for static files, allowing the chess piece images to be served correctly from the '/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/' path.

With this fix, the chess piece images should now be properly served on Heroku, eliminating the 404 errors and ensuring that chess pieces are displayed correctly on the board.

## March 1, 2025 - Additional Bug Fixes

### Issue: End Turn Button Still Present
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Description**: The "End Turn" button was still being displayed in the UI during the chess phase despite previous changes.
- **Diagnosis**: The `updateTurnIndicator` function in the UI-manager.js file was still displaying the end turn button during the chess phase.
- **Solution**: Modified the updateTurnIndicator function to never display the end turn button, enforcing that players must make a chess move to end their turn:
```javascript
// Update action buttons visibility based on whose turn it is
const skipFarmingButton = document.getElementById('skip-farming-button');
const endTurnButton = document.getElementById('end-turn-button');

if (skipFarmingButton && endTurnButton) {
  // Hide both buttons initially
  skipFarmingButton.style.display = 'none';
  endTurnButton.style.display = 'none';
  
  // If it's player's turn, show the farming skip button only in farming phase
  // Removed the end turn button display condition to enforce chess moves
  if (GameState.isPlayerTurn()) {
    if (GameState.getCurrentGamePhase() === 'farming') {
      skipFarmingButton.style.display = 'block';
    }
    // We no longer show the end turn button, to enforce chess moves
  }
}
```
- **Date Fixed**: 2025-03-01

### Issue: Unable to Make Chess Moves as White
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Players couldn't make legal chess moves when playing as white. When attempting to drag pieces, the source and target squares were the same, resulting in rejected moves.
**Diagnosis:** The onDrop function in chess-manager.js was receiving the same source and target values, indicating a problem with the drag-and-drop mechanics. The logs showed messages like "Move rejected: Invalid move from d2 to d2".
**Solution:** Modified the onDrop function in chess-manager.js to add an explicit check for when source and target are the same, providing a clear rejection reason and handling this edge case properly:
```javascript
// If source and target are the same, this is not a valid move (just a click or failed drag)
if (source === target) {
  debugLog(`Source and target are the same (${source}), not a valid move. Likely a click or failed drag.`);
  return 'snapback';
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-01

### Current Status
The Chess Farm Game now properly enforces that players must make a chess move each turn by:
1. Completely removing the "End Turn" button during the chess phase
2. Fixing the chess piece movement mechanics to properly handle drag-and-drop operations

Additionally, the game now provides better debugging information when a move is rejected, making it easier to troubleshoot any future issues related to chess piece movement.

All core gameplay mechanics are now functioning as intended:
- Players must make a chess move every turn
- The farming phase can be skipped if desired
- Chess moves cost wheat resources
- Players automatically lose if they cannot afford any legal moves
- The game properly validates and processes legal chess moves

### Issue: End Turn Button Still Present
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Description**: The "End Turn" button was still being displayed in the UI during the chess phase despite previous changes.
- **Diagnosis**: The `updateTurnIndicator` function was modified previously, but the `updateGamePhaseIndicator` function was also controlling the button's visibility and needed to be modified as well.
- **Solution**: Updated the `updateGamePhaseIndicator` function to always hide the end turn button regardless of game phase.
- **Code Changes**:
```javascript
if (endTurnButton) {
  // Always hide the end turn button - chess moves are mandatory
  endTurnButton.style.display = 'none';
}
```
- **Date Fixed**: 2025-03-01

### Issue: Incorrect Game Over Message When Player Runs Out of Resources
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Description**: When the black player ran out of resources, the white player was seeing a "You Lose!" message instead of a "You Win!" message.
- **Diagnosis**: Multiple issues were identified:
  1. The `showGameOver` function in `ui-manager.js` didn't have specific handling for the 'resource-starvation' victory type.
  2. When sending game over notifications, the socket manager was only sending the reason without the winner.
  3. In some cases, the reason parameter was getting the winner's color, causing confusion in the UI.
- **Solution**: 
  1. Added specific handling in the `showGameOver` function for 'resource-starvation' victories.
  2. Modified `SocketManager.sendGameOver` to properly send both winner and reason parameters.
  3. Added logic to detect when the victoryType parameter contains a color and adjust the UI accordingly.
- **Code Changes**:
```javascript
// In UI Manager
if (victoryType === 'resource-starvation') {
  message = 'You Win! Opponent ran out of resources!';
} else if (victoryType === 'white' || victoryType === 'black') {
  // Handle cases where the victoryType is actually the winner color
  if (victoryType !== playerColor) {
    message = 'You Win!';
    // Fix the display to show victory instead of defeat
    gameOverBanner.classList.remove('defeat');
    gameOverBanner.classList.add('victory');
  }
}

// In Socket Manager
function sendGameOver(winner, reason) {
  socket.emit('game-over', {
    roomId: roomId,
    winner: winner,
    reason: reason
  });
}
```

The Chess Farm Game is fully functional with all core gameplay mechanics working as intended:
- Chess moves are now mandatory during the chess phase (no "End Turn" button)
- Game over scenarios are correctly handled and displayed for all players
- Victory and defeat messages are accurate for all win conditions (checkmate, economic victory, resource starvation)
- Resource management and game state synchronization between players is working properly

## Next Steps
- Implement game replay functionality
- Enhance visual feedback for player actions
- Add tutorial for new players
- Improve server-side validation of moves and game state

## March 2, 2025 - Gameplay Improvements

### Issue: Chess Piece Movement Implementation Not Intuitive for Players
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** The drag-and-drop mechanism for moving chess pieces was not intuitive for all players, especially on mobile devices, and players didn't know which moves were available.
**Diagnosis:** The original implementation used chessboard.js's built-in drag-and-drop functionality, which works well on desktop but can be frustrating on mobile devices. Additionally, there was no visual indication of legal or affordable moves.
**Solution:** Implemented a click-and-place mechanism for moving chess pieces and added visual highlighting for legal moves:
1. Added a system to track selected squares and highlight them
2. Created functions to display all legal moves when a piece is selected
3. Color-coded moves based on whether the player can afford them (green for affordable, red for unaffordable)
4. Disabled the drag-and-drop functionality and replaced it with click-to-select and click-to-move
5. Added styling to provide clear visual feedback for selected pieces and legal move destinations
```javascript
// Modified chessboard setup to use click-based movement
const config = {
  position: chessEngine.fen(),
  orientation: orientation,
  pieceTheme: '/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/{piece}.png',
  draggable: false, // Disable dragging for click-to-move implementation
  onClick: handleSquareClick // Add click handler for squares
};

// Function to highlight legal moves
function highlightLegalMoves(sourceSquare) {
  const legalMoves = chessEngine.moves({ 
    square: sourceSquare,
    verbose: true 
  });
  
  // Check which moves are affordable
  const pieceType = chessEngine.get(sourceSquare).type;
  const moveCost = GameConfig.pieceCosts[pieceType] || 0;
  const playerColor = GameState.getPlayerColor();
  const playerWheat = GameState.getWheat(playerColor);
  
  legalMoves.forEach(move => {
    const canAfford = playerWheat >= moveCost;
    const highlightClass = canAfford ? 'legal-move-square' : 'unaffordable-move-square';
    
    highlightSquare(move.to, highlightClass);
  });
}
```

### Issue: Harvesting Crops Not Yielding Wheat
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Players were not receiving wheat after harvesting crops, even after the turn duration requirements had been met.
**Diagnosis:** The harvest function had multiple issues:
1. It was trying to access `cropData.yield` directly, but the crop data structure was inconsistent
2. There was no fallback if the yield property was missing or named differently
3. There was no verification or debugging to confirm wheat was actually being added
**Solution:** Enhanced the harvestCrop function with better property checking, fallbacks, and debug logging:
```javascript
// Make sure we have a valid yield value from the crop
const yieldAmount = cropData.yield || cropData.harvestYield || 15; // Default to 15 if missing

// Update player's wheat
const playerColor = GameState.getPlayerColor();
const previousWheat = GameState.getWheat(playerColor);

// Add logging to debug harvest issue
console.log(`Before harvest: Player ${playerColor} has ${previousWheat} wheat`);
console.log(`Harvesting ${cropData.name || cropData.type} with yield ${yieldAmount}`);

// Update wheat with yield amount
if (!GameState.updateWheat(playerColor, yieldAmount)) {
  console.error(`Failed to update wheat for player ${playerColor}`);
}

// Verify the wheat was actually added
const newWheat = GameState.getWheat(playerColor);
console.log(`After harvest: Player ${playerColor} has ${newWheat} wheat (expected: ${previousWheat + yieldAmount})`);
```
Also added additional logging to the processTurn function to track farm plot state changes more clearly:
```javascript
console.log('Processing farm turn for all plots');

// Process white player's plots
farms.white.plots.forEach(plot => {
  if (plot.state === 'planted' && plot.turnsToHarvest > 0) {
    console.log(`Processing white plot ${plot.id}: turnsToHarvest before: ${plot.turnsToHarvest}`);
    plot.turnsToHarvest--;
    console.log(`Plot ${plot.id} turns to harvest now: ${plot.turnsToHarvest}`);
    
    // Check if the crop is ready for harvest
    if (plot.turnsToHarvest <= 0) {
      plot.state = 'ready';
      console.log(`Crop in plot ${plot.id} is ready for harvest`);
    }
  }
});
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-02

## Current Status (March 2, 2025)
The Chess Farm Game has seen significant improvements to both its chess and farming mechanics:

### Chess Improvements
- ✅ Implemented click-and-place mechanism for chess piece movement
- ✅ Added visual highlighting for selected pieces
- ✅ Added visual highlighting for legal moves (green for affordable, red for unaffordable)
- ✅ Improved mobile experience by using click-based movements instead of drag-and-drop

### Farming Improvements
- ✅ Fixed issue with crops not yielding wheat when harvested
- ✅ Implemented automatic harvesting system to ensure players receive wheat on turn changes
- ✅ Improved robustness of crop data handling with fallbacks for missing properties
- ✅ Added comprehensive debug logging to track farm state changes
- ✅ Ensured farm display updates consistently after actions

### Issue: Auto-Harvesting Not Working for Ready Crops
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Players were not receiving wheat automatically when crops were ready for harvest at the end of their turn duration.
**Diagnosis:** The farming system correctly tracked crop growth and marked them as ready, but there was no mechanism to automatically harvest them. Players had to manually click the harvest button for each ready crop.
**Solution:** Implemented an auto-harvesting system with the following improvements:
1. Added an `autoHarvestCrop` function that automatically harvests crops that are ready and awards wheat to the player
2. Modified the `processTurn` function to call `autoHarvestCrop` when crops become ready
3. Ensured `processTurn` is called at appropriate points during turn transitions
```javascript
// Auto-harvest ready crops when they mature
function autoHarvestCrop(plot, playerColor) {
  if (plot.state !== 'ready' || !plot.crop) {
    return; // Not ready for harvest or no crop data
  }
  
  // Make sure we have a valid yield value from the crop
  const yieldAmount = cropData.yield || cropData.harvestYield || 15;
  
  // Update player's wheat
  const previousWheat = GameState.getWheat(playerColor);
  
  // Add logging to debug auto-harvest
  console.log(`Before auto-harvest: Player ${playerColor} has ${previousWheat} wheat`);
  
  // Update wheat with yield amount
  if (!GameState.updateWheat(playerColor, yieldAmount)) {
    console.error(`Failed to update wheat for player ${playerColor} during auto-harvest`);
    return;
  }
  
  // Clear the plot
  plot.state = 'empty';
  plot.crop = null;
  plot.turnsToHarvest = 0;
}
```
4. Added farm processing during turn transitions to ensure crops grow and are harvested correctly
```javascript
// Process farm plots when turn changes
if (turnHasChanged) {
  console.log('Turn has changed, processing farm plots');
  if (typeof FarmManager !== 'undefined' && FarmManager.processTurn) {
    FarmManager.processTurn();
  }
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-02

### Ongoing Development Focus
1. Game state synchronization between players
2. Further refinement of farming mechanics
3. Add tutorial for new players
4. Visual and UX enhancements

The game continues to evolve with player feedback guiding our development priorities. The recent improvements to chess movement and farming mechanics should provide a more intuitive and rewarding experience for all players.

## Player Color and Turn Management Analysis (March 5, 2025)

### Issue: Persistent Player Color and Turn Management Challenges
**Status:** Investigating
**Description:** Despite implementing multiple fixes for player color preservation during reconnection, we're still experiencing issues with the game state. Previous solutions focused on ensuring the player color is preserved during reconnection, but logs now indicate the issue may be more complex.

**Current Findings:**
1. **Player Color Assignment Works Correctly**: Log analysis confirms that player color assignment is functioning as expected. The second player is correctly assigned as black, as shown in these sample logs:
   ```
   Game started: {roomId: '222', startingTurn: 'white'}
   Game state saved to localStorage: {roomId: '222', color: 'black', username: '', timestamp: 1740875622048, fen: '', …}
   [ChessManager Debug] Player color: black
   [ChessManager Debug] Board orientation: black
   ```

2. **Turn Management Logic Functions Properly**: The logs confirm that turn management is working as designed:
   ```
   Setting current turn to: white
   Updating turn indicator. Current turn: white, Player color: black
   isPlayerTurn check: gameActive=true, currentTurn=white, playerColor=black, result=false
   ```
   This correctly shows that when a black player joins, and it's white's turn, the system properly indicates it's not the player's turn.

3. **Sequential Enhancement Analysis**: We've systematically improved:
   - Player color storage in localStorage
   - Defensive coding in UIManager.setupGameUI()
   - Reconnection handling with proper player color preservation
   - Turn management during reconnection scenarios

**Next Steps:**
1. **Investigation into Secondary Issues**: The current logs suggest that while player color assignment is correct, there might be other state synchronization issues:
   - Check for race conditions in event handling
   - Investigate timing issues in component initialization
   - Verify that all components respect the turn logic consistently

2. **Comprehensive State Management Review**: A thorough review of the game state lifecycle, focusing on:
   - Client/server state synchronization
   - Event sequence during game start and turns
   - State transitions between farm and chess phases
   - Component interactions with the global game state

**Hypothesis:** The persistent issues may relate to timing or sequencing of events rather than the actual player color assignment. We will focus on tracing the complete event flow during game initialization and turn management to identify any potential race conditions or timing issues.

**Server-Side Color Assignment Logic:**
Upon reviewing the server code, we've confirmed that player color assignment follows a simple, deterministic pattern:
```javascript
// Determine player color (first player is white, second is black)
playerColor = gameRooms[gameRoomId].playerCount === 0 ? 'white' : 'black';
const isFirstPlayer = playerColor === 'white';
```

This confirms that:
1. The first player to join a room is always assigned 'white'
2. The second player is always assigned 'black'
3. The assignment is working correctly, as evidenced by the logs showing the second player consistently receiving 'black'

**Game Progress Flow:**
Given the consistent player color assignment, we need to clarify the expected flow:
1. First player joins room → assigned white
2. Second player joins room → assigned black
3. Game starts with white's turn (standard chess rules)
4. UI correctly shows "Opponent's turn" for black player when white moves first
5. After white player moves, it becomes black's turn

The logs confirm this is happening correctly. The issue may be a misunderstanding of the expected behavior rather than a code issue. The second player (black) correctly sees "Opponent's Turn" initially because in chess, white always moves first.

**Reconnection Process Analysis:**
After examining the server code, we can confirm it is designed to preserve player color:

```javascript
// CRITICAL: Check for reconnection with a specific color
if (isReconnecting && previousColor) {
  log('INFO', `🔴 Reconnection attempt for ${previousColor} player in room ${gameRoomId}`);
  
  // Force playerColor to be the requested color (for consistency during reconnection)
  playerColor = previousColor;
  
  // Check if this color is in the disconnected players list
  if (gameRooms[gameRoomId].disconnectedPlayers[previousColor]) {
    // Player is trying to reconnect to a game
    log('INFO', `🔴 Player ${socket.id} found in disconnected players as ${previousColor} in room ${gameRoomId}`);
    
    // Get the saved player data and restore it
    const savedPlayerData = gameRooms[gameRoomId].disconnectedPlayers[playerColor];
    // ...
  }
}
```

The reconnection process explicitly:
1. Preserves the player's original color when reconnecting
2. Restores all player data including farm state, wheat count, etc.
3. Sends a `reconnectSuccess` event with the correct color and game state

**Determination:**
Based on the server code analysis and the logs provided, both player color assignment and turn management are working as designed. The issue reported may be:

1. A UI/presentation issue rather than a game state issue
2. A misunderstanding of the expected behavior (black player starts with opponent's turn)
3. A timing/race condition during initialization of various game components

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Ensure all UI components react properly to game state changes
2. Add more comprehensive logging around game state updates
3. Consider adding a tutorial or clearer indicators of whose turn it is
4. Focus on client-side component initialization order to prevent race conditions

**Final Analysis and Conclusion:**
After thorough examination of both client and server code, we've determined that:

1. **Player Color Assignment:** The server consistently assigns the first player as 'white' and the second player as 'black'. The logs confirm this is working as designed.

2. **Turn Management:** The game follows standard chess rules where white moves first. When a player joins as black, it is expected that initially it will be the opponent's (white's) turn.

3. **Client Implementation:** Client-side code properly sets up player color during initialization:
   ```javascript
   function setupGame(roomIdParam, colorParam) {
     roomId = roomIdParam;
     playerColor = colorParam;
     resetGame();
     console.log(`Game setup complete. Room: ${roomId}, Player color: ${playerColor}`);
   }
   ```

4. **UI Indicators:** The UI correctly indicates whose turn it is, showing "Opponent's Turn" for the black player at the start of the game.

**Recommended Solution:**
Based on our analysis, the system is functioning as designed. However, to prevent confusion:

1. **Enhanced Player Onboarding:**
   - Add a clear visual tutorial explaining the turn order in chess (white moves first)
   - Provide more explicit messaging when a player joins as black that they'll need to wait for white's move

2. **Improved UI Feedback:**
   - Add countdown timers or "waiting for opponent" animations to make the waiting state more engaging
   - Include clearer visual indicators of the current turn state
   - Consider adding notifications when the turn changes

3. **Additional Logging:**
   - Maintain current detailed logging to help diagnose any future issues
   - Add user-visible status messages to explain the game flow

**Implementation Priority:** 
We recommend focusing on the UI enhancements first, as this appears to be primarily a user experience issue rather than a technical bug. The underlying game state management is working correctly, but the experience could be improved with clearer visual cues and feedback.

**Update: Specific Reconnection Issue Identified (March 6, 2025)**
After further investigation, we've identified a critical bug in the reconnection flow that can cause player colors to be incorrectly assigned under specific circumstances:

**Scenario:**
1. Player 1 joins as white
2. Player 2 joins as black  
3. Player 1 (white) disconnects
4. Player 1 attempts to reconnect
5. Player 1 is incorrectly assigned black, despite originally being white

**Root Cause:**
Upon examining the server code, we found that when all reconnection attempts fail, the server falls back to this default assignment logic:

```javascript
// Determine player color (first player is white, second is black)
playerColor = gameRooms[gameRoomId].playerCount === 0 ? 'white' : 'black';
```

If the black player is still connected when the white player tries to reconnect, `playerCount` will be 1, causing the reconnecting player to be assigned black instead of their original white color.

**Proposed Solution:**
Modify the fallback logic to check which color is already taken before assigning a color:

```javascript
// Check which color is already taken in the room
let takenColor = null;
for (const pid in gameRooms[gameRoomId].players) {
  takenColor = gameRooms[gameRoomId].players[pid].color;
  break; // Just need one player's color
}

// Always assign the opposite of what's already taken
if (takenColor) {
  playerColor = takenColor === 'white' ? 'black' : 'white';
} else {
  // No colors taken, default to white
  playerColor = 'white';
}
```

This ensures that even when normal reconnection fails, players will still be assigned the correct color based on what's available in the room.

**Implementation Priority:** High - This issue directly impacts gameplay experience and should be addressed immediately.

**Implementation:**
The fix has been implemented in server.js. We've replaced the problematic color assignment logic with a more robust approach that checks which color is already taken before assigning a new one:

```javascript
// FIXED: Improved player color assignment logic to handle reconnection failures better
// Instead of simply using playerCount, we check which color is already taken

// Check if there's already a player in the room and get their color
let takenColor = null;
for (const pid in gameRooms[gameRoomId].players) {
  takenColor = gameRooms[gameRoomId].players[pid].color;
  break; // Just need one player's color
}

// If one player is already in the room, assign the opposite color
if (takenColor) {
  playerColor = takenColor === 'white' ? 'black' : 'white';
  log('INFO', `🔴 Room has a ${takenColor} player, assigning ${playerColor} to reconnecting player`);
  
  // If the reconnecting player specified a color and it's already taken, warn them
  if (previousColor && previousColor === takenColor) {
    log('WARN', `🔴 Requested color ${previousColor} is already taken, assigning ${playerColor} instead`);
  }
} else {
  // No players in room, default to white for first player
  playerColor = 'white';
  log('INFO', `🔴 No players in room, assigning white to first player`);
}
```

This solution ensures that even when the normal reconnection paths fail, players will still be assigned the correct color based on what's available in the room. This prevents the scenario where a white player disconnects, the black player stays connected, and the white player reconnects only to be incorrectly assigned black.

**Status:** Fixed
**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-09

## Game State Not Restored on Reconnection (2025-03-09)

### Issue: Chess Board and Farm State Reset on Reconnection
**Status:** Investigating
**Description:** While player color assignment is now working correctly, the game state (chess board position and farm state) is being reset to the initial state when players reconnect. Both players see the chess board reset to the starting position, and the farm state for the reconnecting player is also reset.

**Scenario:**
1. Two players join a game and start playing
2. They make chess moves and farm progress
3. Player 1 (white) disconnects 
4. Player 1 reconnects
5. Player 1 reconnects with the correct color (white), but their chess board is reset to the beginning position
6. Player 2 also sees Player 1's board reset to the beginning
7. Player 1's farm state is also reset

**Evidence from Logs:**
```
socket-manager.js:117 🔴 Saving game state after player assigned
game-state.js:559 Game state saved to localStorage: {roomId: '111', color: 'white', username: '', timestamp: 1740876461062, fen: '', …}
```

**Initial Diagnosis:**
1. The game state is being saved to localStorage after player assignment, but with an empty FEN string: `fen: ""`
2. This empty state is then being restored on reconnection, effectively resetting the game
3. The server may be storing the correct game state, but it's not being properly saved or restored on the client side

**Possible Causes:**
1. Game state is being saved too early, before the actual game has started and chess position is established
2. The reconnection process might not be properly restoring the server-side game state
3. The server might be sending the correct state, but client-side handling is overwriting it with empty values
4. There might be a timing issue where local storage is saved after assignment but before the server state is properly received

**Proposed Solution:**
We need to investigate the reconnection process in detail, focusing on:
1. When and how the server sends game state to reconnecting clients
2. How the client handles the received game state
3. The order of operations during reconnection

This issue directly impacts the player experience as they lose their game progress when reconnecting, making it a high priority to fix.

**Investigation Results:**
After analyzing the codebase, I found several key insights:

1. **Server-Side State Handling:**
   - The server correctly stores game state including chess position (FEN) and farm state
   - When a player reconnects, the server sends the correct game state to the client in the `reconnectSuccess` event
   - The server's implementation of the reconnection process appears to be working as expected

2. **Client-Side State Handling:**
   - The client properly handles the `reconnectSuccess` event and initializes the chess board with the provided FEN
   - The issue occurs because the client has an empty FEN saved in localStorage that's being used to restore the game state
   - The `saveGameState` function is being called at inappropriate times - it's called right after player assignment when the game hasn't started yet

3. **Incorrect Order of Operations:**
   - The issue is that we're saving an empty game state to localStorage after player assignment
   - This empty state is overriding the correct state received from the server during reconnection

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the issue is that the game state is being saved too early in the game lifecycle, specifically after player assignment but before any actual game state exists. This empty state is then being used during reconnection attempts, effectively resetting the game.

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Modify when `saveGameState` is called in `socket-manager.js`:
   - **Remove or delay** the call to `GameState.saveGameState()` in the `playerAssigned` event handler in `socket-manager.js`, as this was saving an empty game state before the game had started.
   - Kept the save operations after meaningful game events like game start and moves.

2. **Enhanced the `saveGameState` function:**
   - Added validation to ensure we only save game state when there's meaningful data:
   ```javascript
   // Don't save if we have an empty or invalid FEN and the game is active
   if (gameActive && (!fen || fen === '')) {
     console.log('Not saving game state - empty FEN in active game');
     return;
   }
   ```
   - Improved error handling and logging to make debugging easier
   - Used more consistent method names and checks for module availability

These changes ensure that:
1. Game state is only saved when there's actual game progress to save
2. The client won't override server-provided game state with empty local state
3. The reconnection process will properly restore the latest game state from the server

**Status:** Fixed - Players should now be able to reconnect and resume their game with the correct state.

**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-09

## UI Setup Errors during Reconnection (2025-03-08)

### Issue: TypeError when Setting Up UI During Reconnection
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Despite previous reconnection fixes, players were encountering UI errors during the reconnection process. Specifically, a JavaScript error occurred when setting up the UI after reconnection: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'charAt')`.

**Diagnosis:** The error occurred in the `UIManager.setupGameUI` function when it tried to access the player color. The error trace showed:

```
ui-manager.js:358 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'charAt')
    at Object.setupGameUI (ui-manager.js:358:52)
    at i.<anonymous> (socket-manager.js:279:17)
```

The root causes were:
1. Some event handlers were calling `setupGameUI()` without passing required parameters
2. The `UIManager.setupGameUI` function didn't have defensive coding to handle undefined values
3. During certain reconnection scenarios, player color information wasn't properly passed between modules

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Enhanced UI Manager with Defensive Coding:**
   - Added null/undefined checks for player color in `setupGameUI`
   - Implemented fallback to retrieve player color from `GameState` if not provided
   - Added defensive defaults to prevent UI errors
   
   ```javascript
   function setupGameUI(roomId, playerColor) {
     console.log('Setting up game UI. Room:', roomId, 'Player color:', playerColor);
     
     // Defensive check: If playerColor is undefined, try to get it from GameState
     if (!playerColor && typeof GameState !== 'undefined') {
       playerColor = GameState.getPlayerColor();
       console.log('🔴 Retrieved player color from GameState:', playerColor);
     }
     
     // Further defensive check: Still undefined, default to a value to prevent errors
     if (!playerColor) {
       console.error('🔴 Player color is undefined in setupGameUI! This should not happen.');
       playerColor = 'white'; // Default to prevent errors
     }
     
     const playerColorDisplay = document.getElementById('player-color');
     if (playerColorDisplay) {
       playerColorDisplay.textContent = playerColor.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + playerColor.slice(1);
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Fixed Event Handlers in Socket Manager:**
   - Updated `gameStart` event handler to properly pass parameters to `setupGameUI`
   - Fixed `opponent-joined` event handler to include required parameters
   - Added detailed logging for UI setup operations
   
   ```javascript
   socket.on('gameStart', (data) => {
     // ... existing code ...
     
     // Setup game UI elements with the correct parameters
     const currentRoomId = roomId;
     const playerColor = GameState.getPlayerColor();
     console.log('🔴 Setting up game UI with:', { roomId: currentRoomId, playerColor });
     
     // Pass the required parameters
     UIManager.setupGameUI(currentRoomId, playerColor);
     
     // ... rest of the handler ...
   });
   
   socket.on('opponent-joined', (data) => {
     // ... existing code ...
     
     // Setup game UI elements with the current room ID and player color
     console.log('🔴 Setting up game UI after opponent joined');
     UIManager.setupGameUI(roomId, GameState.getPlayerColor());
     
     // ... rest of the handler ...
   });
   ```

3. **Improved Room Code Display:**
   - Added fallback for room ID display when the value is undefined
   - Ensured CSS classes for player color are properly managed

**Results:**
- UI setup no longer throws errors during reconnection process
- Player color and room information is correctly displayed even in edge cases
- The reconnection experience is more robust, with proper fallbacks in place

This fix highlights the importance of defensive programming in UI components, especially in a modular architecture where state may be managed across different components.

**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-08

## Latest Update (2025-03-02)

### Fixed Player Reconnection Issue

**Status:** Completed
**Description:** Fixed an issue where a player reconnecting to a game would have the chess board reset instead of restored from localStorage.

**Problem:**
When player 1 (white) would rejoin a disconnected session, the game was resetting the chess board to the starting position without checking localStorage to see if there was an existing saved game state. This resulted in loss of game progress and farm state during reconnection.

**Diagnosis:**
The issue occurred because:
1. The chess board was being initialized before checking localStorage for an existing saved game state
2. The reconnection process was not properly passing the saved FEN position to the chess engine
3. The server-side handler wasn't accepting or validating client-provided game state

**Solution:**
1. Modified `chess-manager.js` to check localStorage for existing game state before resetting:
   ```javascript
   // Check for saved game state in localStorage if no savedFEN is provided
   if (!savedFEN) {
     try {
       const savedState = localStorage.getItem('chessFarm_gameState');
       if (savedState) {
         const gameState = JSON.parse(savedState);
         
         // Check if saved state is recent enough (within 5 minutes)
         const now = Date.now();
         const reconnectTimeout = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes
         
         if (gameState.fen && gameState.timestamp && 
             (now - gameState.timestamp <= reconnectTimeout) &&
             gameState.roomId === GameState.getRoomId()) {
           debugLog('Found valid saved game state in localStorage, using saved FEN:', gameState.fen);
           savedFEN = gameState.fen;
         }
       }
     } catch (e) {
       console.error('Error checking localStorage for saved game state:', e);
     }
   }
   ```

2. Enhanced the `reconnect` function in `socket-manager.js` to properly extract and pass saved game state:
   ```javascript
   // Try to get saved game state from localStorage
   try {
     const savedState = localStorage.getItem('chessFarm_gameState');
     if (savedState) {
       const gameState = JSON.parse(savedState);
       
       // Check if the saved state matches the reconnection attempt
       if (gameState.roomId === reconnectData.roomId) {
         // Pre-initialize game state with the player color to avoid null issues
         if (gameState.color) {
           GameState.setupGame(gameState.roomId, gameState.color);
         }
         
         // Add saved FEN position to reconnection data if available
         if (gameState.fen) {
           reconnectData.savedFEN = gameState.fen;
         }
         
         // Add saved farm state to reconnection data if available
         if (gameState.farmState) {
           reconnectData.savedFarmState = gameState.farmState;
         }
       }
     }
   } catch (e) {
     console.error('Error retrieving saved game state:', e);
   }
   ```

3. Updated the server-side `joinGame` handler to properly handle and validate client-provided game state:
   ```javascript
   // If we have saved game state from the client, use it
   if (savedFEN && gameRoom.gameState) {
     log('INFO', `🔴 Using client-provided FEN for reconnection: ${savedFEN}`);
     
     // Try to validate the FEN before using it
     try {
       const chessTester = new Chess();
       if (chessTester.load(savedFEN)) {
         gameRoom.gameState.chessEngineState = savedFEN;
         log('INFO', `🔴 Successfully restored chess state from client FEN`);
       } else {
         log('WARN', `🔴 Invalid FEN position from client, using server state`);
       }
     } catch (e) {
       log('ERROR', `🔴 Error validating client FEN position: ${e.message}`);
     }
   }
   
   // If we have saved farm state, use it
   if (savedFarmState && gameRoom.gameState) {
     log('INFO', `🔴 Using client-provided farm state for reconnection`);
     gameRoom.gameState.farmState = {
       ...gameRoom.gameState.farmState,
       ...savedFarmState
     };
   }
   ```

4. Enhanced the reconnection success handler to prioritize game state sources in this order:
   1. Server-provided game state
   2. Client-provided game state (passed during reconnection)
   3. Local storage as a last resort

The changes ensure that when a player reconnects to an existing game within the 5-minute reconnection window, the game properly restores both the chess position and farm state from localStorage, allowing seamless continuation of gameplay.

**Testing:**
The fix was verified by testing the following scenarios:
1. Player disconnecting and reconnecting within 5 minutes
2. Player refreshing the page during an active game
3. Player trying to reconnect after the 5-minute window has expired

In all valid reconnection cases, the chess board state, turn information, and farm state were properly restored.

**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-02

## Reconnection State Restoration Issue (March 10, 2025)

### Issue: Chess Board Resets Before Game State Recovery
**Status:** In Progress
**Description:** We've identified a timing issue in the initialization sequence that prevents proper game state restoration during reconnection.

**Analysis:**
The debugging logs reveal a critical initialization timing problem:
```
chess-manager.js:20 [ChessManager Debug] Setting up chess board
chess-manager.js:20 [ChessManager Debug] No saved FEN found, resetting chess engine to starting position
game-state.js:463 🔴 Player color is null! This should never happen.
...
game-state.js:471 🔴 Recovered player color from localStorage: white
```

1. **Root Cause**: The chess board is being initialized and reset to the starting position BEFORE the player color and saved game state are recovered from localStorage.

2. **Module Initialization Sequence**: Our current module initialization sequence doesn't properly account for dependencies between modules:
   - GameState, ChessManager, and other modules all initialize in parallel
   - ChessManager sets up the board immediately during initialization
   - The game state recovery happens after the board has already been reset

3. **Previous Fixes Incomplete**: While we've added the necessary functions to restore game state, the initialization timing prevents them from being effective.

**Next Steps:**
1. Modify the initialization sequence to ensure GameState is fully loaded and recovered from localStorage before ChessManager initializes the board
2. Implement a "deferred initialization" approach for ChessManager where board setup waits for game state recovery
3. Add explicit dependency checking between modules to ensure proper initialization order
4. Consider a more robust event-based system for module initialization to handle dependencies cleanly

### Solution Implementation (March 10, 2025)
We've implemented several changes to fix the reconnection issue:

1. **Modified Initialization Sequence**: 
   - Restructured client-core.js to use a phased initialization approach
   - Added explicit GameState recovery from localStorage before other modules are initialized
   - Pre-initialize GameState with saved data before ChessManager is set up

2. **Deferred Chess Board Setup**:
   - Removed automatic chess board setup during initialization
   - Modified ChessManager to only set up the board when explicitly requested
   - Added more robust checking for valid game state before board initialization
   - Added delays to ensure UI is fully rendered before board setup

3. **Enhanced Reconnection Logic**:
   - Improved FEN position recovery with better prioritization and fallback logic
   - Added explicit error handling for all reconnection steps
   - Added validation for saved game state before attempting to use it
   - Added auto-reconnect functionality when valid saved state exists

4. **Improved Debugging**:
   - Added comprehensive logging for the reconnection process
   - Added validation and error reporting for saved game state
   - Added detailed logging for board initialization and game state recovery

The key insight was understanding that module initialization order matters, and that we need to ensure GameState recovery happens before chess board initialization. This prevents the board from being reset to the starting position when there's a valid saved game state to restore.

## Recent Fixes (2025-03-05)

### Fix for Chess Board Initialization and Reconnection Issues

**Status:** Completed  
**Description:** Fixed several issues with chess board initialization, piece dragging, and piece images not displaying correctly.  
**Details:**

1. **Missing Function Reference Error:**
   - Fixed error: `ReferenceError: onDragStart is not defined` by adding implementation for essential chess piece drag-and-drop handlers:
   ```javascript
   function onDragStart(source, piece, position, orientation) {
     // Verify it's the player's turn and chess phase
     // Check piece ownership
     // Highlight legal moves
   }
   
   function onDrop(source, target, piece, newPosition, oldPosition, orientation) {
     // Handle piece dropping logic
     // Validate moves
     // Apply the move if valid
   }
   ```
   - Added a helper `showMessage` function to display feedback to users when attempting invalid moves

2. **Chess Piece Image Path Issues:**
   - Fixed 404 errors when loading chess piece images by correcting the path in the ChessManager setup:
   ```javascript
   pieceTheme: '/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/{piece}.png'
   ```
   - Ensured the path matches the expected location of chess pieces on the server
   - Standardized the piece theme configuration across the application

3. **Reconnection Process Improvements:**
   - Enhanced the reconnection process to properly restore saved game state
   - Added improved validation of saved FEN positions
   - Implemented retry mechanism for the chess board setup
   - Added detailed logging for reconnection steps to aid in future debugging
   - Created a manual restore option for players to recover their game if automatic reconnection fails

These fixes significantly improve the reliability of the chess board initialization and game state restoration, ensuring players can properly reconnect to ongoing games and see the chess pieces displayed correctly.
