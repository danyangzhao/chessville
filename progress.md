# Chess Farm Game - Development Progress

## Project Overview
This document tracks the development progress of the Chess Farm Game, a multiplayer chess game with integrated farming mechanics. The game allows players to:
- Play chess against each other online
- Manage farm resources (wheat)
- Use wheat to make chess moves
- Earn wheat by capturing opponent pieces and farming

## Current Structure
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with chessboard.js and chess.js libraries
- Backend: Node.js with Express and Socket.io for real-time communication
- Game mechanics: Chess gameplay with resource management

## Issues and Fixes

### Issue: Chess piece images not displaying
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Chess pieces were not being displayed on the chessboard.
**Diagnosis:** The `pieceTheme` configuration in app.js was pointing to a Lichess URL that might not be accessible.
**Solution:** Updated the `pieceTheme` URL to use the official chessboardjs.com image source:
```javascript
pieceTheme: 'https://chessboardjs.com/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/{piece}.png'
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Chess piece images still not displaying in chess-manager.js
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Despite fixing the app.js pieceTheme, chess pieces were still not displaying when using chess-manager.js.
**Diagnosis:** The chess-manager.js file was missing the pieceTheme configuration in the chessboard setup.
**Solution:** Added the same pieceTheme configuration to chess-manager.js:
```javascript
pieceTheme: 'https://chessboardjs.com/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/{piece}.png'
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Server port conflict
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Server was unable to start due to port 3001 already being in use.
**Diagnosis:** Another process was already using port 3001, causing the "EADDRINUSE" error.
**Solution:** Changed the server port from 3001 to 3002 in server.js:
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3002;
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Game room not found error
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** When attempting to join room '111', players received a "Game room not found" error.
**Diagnosis:** The server was rejecting attempts to join non-existent rooms rather than creating them.
**Solution:** Modified the joinGame handler in server.js to create a new room if the requested room ID doesn't exist:
```javascript
// Check if the room exists - if not, create it (useful for rejoining specific rooms)
if (!gameRooms[gameRoomId]) {
  log('INFO', `Creating new game room with specified ID: ${gameRoomId}`);
  gameRooms[gameRoomId] = {
    id: gameRoomId,
    players: {},
    playerCount: 0,
    gameState: {
      chessEngineState: new Chess().fen(),
      isGameOver: false,
      winner: null
    },
    currentTurn: 'white'
  };
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Chess pieces being displayed upside down
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Chess pieces were being displayed upside down for the black player, which was unnecessary and confusing.
**Diagnosis:** The code in chess-manager.js was applying a 180-degree rotation to chess pieces when the player was black.
**Solution:** Removed the piece rotation code from chess-manager.js, as the chessboard.js library already handles proper piece orientation:
```javascript
// Removed the following code and related functionality:
if (orientation === 'black') {
  debugLog('Rotating pieces for black player');
  const pieces = document.querySelectorAll('img[data-piece], .piece, [class*="piece-"]');
  pieces.forEach(piece => {
    piece.style.transform = 'rotate(180deg)';
  });
  // ... and more related code ...
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Players could skip making chess moves
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Players could end their turn without making a chess move, which wasn't the intended game mechanics.
**Diagnosis:** The game allowed players to toggle between farming and chess phases freely and end their turn even if no chess move was made.
**Solution:** Modified the game to enforce the following rules:
1. Players must make a chess move each turn
2. The phase toggle button only allows switching from farming to chess, not back
3. The endTurn function checks if a chess move was made and prevents ending the turn if not:
```javascript
// Check if the player has made a chess move this turn
if (!gamePhaseCompleted.chess) {
  console.warn('Cannot end turn - you must make a chess move first');
  UIManager.showMessage('You must make a chess move before ending your turn.', 'warning');
  
  // Force switch to chess phase if not already there
  if (currentGamePhase !== 'chess') {
    setCurrentGamePhase('chess');
  }
  
  return false;
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

### Issue: Players could become stuck if they had insufficient resources
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Players with insufficient wheat resources to make any chess moves could become stuck, with no way to proceed.
**Diagnosis:** The game was checking if a single move was affordable, but not if the player had enough resources to make any legal move.
**Solution:** Added a new function in chess-manager.js that checks if the player can afford any legal moves. If not, they automatically lose:
```javascript
function checkIfPlayerCanMakeAnyMoves() {
  // Get the player's color and wheat
  const playerColor = GameState.getPlayerColor();
  const playerWheat = GameState.getWheat(playerColor);
  
  // Get all legal moves
  const legalMoves = chessEngine.moves({ verbose: true });
  
  // Check if any moves are affordable
  let canMakeAnyMove = false;
  
  for (const move of legalMoves) {
    const pieceType = move.piece;
    const moveCost = GameConfig.pieceCosts[pieceType] || 0;
    
    if (playerWheat >= moveCost) {
      canMakeAnyMove = true;
      break;
    }
  }
  
  // If player can't make any moves, they lose
  if (!canMakeAnyMove && legalMoves.length > 0) {
    const opponentColor = playerColor === 'white' ? 'black' : 'white';
    GameState.declareWinner(opponentColor, 'resource-starvation');
    
    showMessage('You have no legal moves you can afford! You lose due to resource starvation.', 'error');
  }
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-02-28

- Automatic loss if a player cannot afford any legal moves

The server is running on port 3002. To play the game:
1. Open http://localhost:3002 in your browser
2. Enter your name and optionally a room code
3. Share the room code with your opponent
4. Once connected, you can play chess and manage your farm

Game rules:
- Players must make a chess move each turn
- Each chess piece costs wheat to move (e.g., Pawn: 1, Rook: 5, Knight: 3)
- If a player cannot afford any legal moves, they automatically lose
- Players can farm to gain more wheat resources
- Capturing opponent pieces gives additional wheat bonuses

Issues resolved:
- Fixed chess piece image display by using the correct CDN URL
- Resolved server port conflict by switching to port 3002
- Fixed game room joining functionality to allow players to create or join specific rooms
- Fixed upside-down chess pieces by removing unnecessary rotation code
- Made chess moves mandatory each turn
- Added automatic game loss for players who cannot afford any legal moves

Next development focus will be on ensuring proper game state synchronization between players and refining the farming mechanics.

## Project Merge and Heroku Deployment (2025-02-28)

### Successful Merge to Main Branch
The Chess Farm Game has been successfully merged from the development branch to the main `/chessville` directory. All files have been properly copied and the game is now functioning correctly in the main branch. The nested `chess-farm-game` directory has been removed to clean up the workspace.

### Heroku Deployment Preparation
To prepare the game for deployment to Heroku, the following steps have been taken:

1. **Port Configuration**: The server has been configured to use `process.env.PORT` which allows Heroku to assign its own port:
   ```javascript
   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3002;
   ```

2. **Procfile**: The Procfile is already set up to instruct Heroku how to run the application:
   ```
   web: node server.js
   ```

3. **Node.js Version**: The package.json includes a specification for the Node.js version to ensure compatibility with Heroku.

4. **Dependencies**: All necessary dependencies are properly listed in package.json.

The game is now ready for Heroku deployment. The next steps are to commit these changes to a Git repository and deploy to Heroku using their CLI or GitHub integration.

## Heroku Deployment Issues (2025-02-28)

The initial Heroku deployment encountered several issues that need to be resolved:

### Issue: Chess.js Module Not Found Error
**Status:** Needs Fix
**Description:** The application crashes on Heroku with a module not found error for chess.js.
**Diagnosis:** The error occurs because Heroku cannot find the expected file path for the chess.js module:
```
Error: Cannot find module '/app/node_modules/chess.js/dist/cjs/chess.js'. Please verify that the package.json has a valid "main" entry
```
**Solution:** Update the chess.js dependency version in package.json. The beta version (1.0.0-beta.6) seems to have a different file structure than what our code expects.
```javascript
// Change from
"chess.js": "^1.0.0-beta.6"
// To
"chess.js": "^0.12.0"
```
Or alternatively, update the import in server.js to match the correct path for the beta version.

### Issue: Chess Piece Images 404 Errors
**Status:** Needs Fix
**Description:** Chess pieces are not displaying on Heroku, resulting in 404 errors for all piece images.
**Diagnosis:** The logs show multiple 404 errors for chess piece images:
```
heroku[router]: at=info method=GET path="/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/wP.png" host=chessville-edb8e53bb6f5.herokuapp.com request_id=d07ff092-9798-4bb7-bd94-58951786bc25 fwd="68.123.11.228" dyno=web.1 connect=0ms service=1ms status=404 bytes=415 protocol=https
```
**Solution:** The application is trying to serve these files from the local server, but they don't exist in our deployment. We need to either:

1. Add the chess piece images to our project in the correct directory structure:
   ```
   /public/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/
   ```

2. Or preferably, update the pieceTheme URLs to use an external CDN that reliably hosts these images:
   ```javascript
   pieceTheme: 'https://unpkg.com/@chrisoakman/chessboardjs@1.0.0/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/{piece}.png'
   ```

### Action Plan for Successful Deployment

1. Fix the chess.js dependency issue by either:
   - Downgrading to a stable version (0.12.0)
   - Updating the import path in server.js

2. Fix the chess piece images by:
   - Adding the image files to our project
   - Updating pieceTheme URLs to use a reliable CDN

3. Re-deploy to Heroku after these changes

These fixes should resolve the application crashes and missing image issues, allowing for successful deployment on Heroku.

## Chess Piece Image Hosting Solution (2025-02-28)

After the initial Heroku deployment fixes, we encountered persistent issues with chess piece images not displaying properly. While we updated the pieceTheme URLs to use the unpkg CDN, this approach still relies on external services that may have reliability or CORS issues.

### Issue: Chess Piece Images Still Not Displaying
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Description:** Despite updating the pieceTheme URLs to use a reliable CDN, chess piece images are still not displaying consistently on Heroku.
**Diagnosis:** External CDN dependencies can be unreliable due to:
1. CORS restrictions
2. CDN availability
3. Network latency
4. Caching issues

**Solution:** Download and serve chess piece images directly from our own server:
1. Create a dedicated directory for chess piece images: `/public/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/`
2. Download all required chess piece images (12 total - 6 piece types in 2 colors)
3. Update pieceTheme URLs to reference our local path:
   ```javascript
   pieceTheme: '/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/{piece}.png'
   ```
4. Ensure the images are included in the Git repository and Heroku deployment

This approach offers several advantages:
- Eliminates dependency on external services
- Reduces latency as images are served from the same origin
- Prevents CORS issues
- Ensures consistent availability
- Chess piece images are small in size (typically <10KB each), so they won't significantly impact deployment size

### Implementation Details
1. ✅ Created the directory structure: `public/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/`
2. ✅ Downloaded chess piece images from the official chessboardjs GitHub repository
3. ✅ Extracted all 12 chess piece images (wP, wR, wN, wB, wQ, wK, bP, bR, bN, bB, bQ, bK)
4. ✅ Updated pieceTheme references in all JavaScript files:
   - js/client-core.js
   - js/modules/chess-manager.js
   - public/js/app.js
5. ✅ Documented the changes in HEROKU_FIXES.md
6. ✅ Committed all changes to the repository

The chess piece images are now served directly from our application, eliminating the dependency on external CDNs and ensuring consistent display of chess pieces across all environments.

## Persistent Chess Piece Image Issues on Heroku (2025-02-28)

Despite implementing local hosting for chess piece images and updating all references to use the local path, we were still experiencing 404 errors for chess piece images when deployed to Heroku:

```
GET https://chessville-edb8e53bb6f5.herokuapp.com/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/wQ.png 404 (Not Found)
GET https://chessville-edb8e53bb6f5.herokuapp.com/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/bP.png 404 (Not Found)
GET https://chessville-edb8e53bb6f5.herokuapp.com/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/wB.png 404 (Not Found)
...and other chess piece images
```

### Issue: Chess Piece Images Not Found on Heroku
**Status:** ✅ Fixed
**Description:** Chess piece images that were successfully added locally were not being found on the Heroku deployment.
**Diagnosis:** The server was not properly configured to serve static files from the 'public' directory. The Express application was only set up to serve static files from the root directory:

```javascript
// Original configuration
app.use(express.static(__dirname));
```

However, our chess piece images were located in the 'public' directory, which wasn't being served correctly.

**Solution:** Added an additional static file middleware to specifically serve files from the 'public' directory:

```javascript
// Updated configuration
app.use(express.static(__dirname));
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
```

This ensures that Express will check both the root directory and the 'public' directory when looking for static files, allowing the chess piece images to be served correctly from the '/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/' path.

With this fix, the chess piece images should now be properly served on Heroku, eliminating the 404 errors and ensuring that chess pieces are displayed correctly on the board.

## March 1, 2025 - Additional Bug Fixes

### Issue: End Turn Button Still Present
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Description**: The "End Turn" button was still being displayed in the UI during the chess phase despite previous changes.
- **Diagnosis**: The `updateTurnIndicator` function in the UI-manager.js file was still displaying the end turn button during the chess phase.
- **Solution**: Modified the updateTurnIndicator function to never display the end turn button, enforcing that players must make a chess move to end their turn:
```javascript
// Update action buttons visibility based on whose turn it is
const skipFarmingButton = document.getElementById('skip-farming-button');
const endTurnButton = document.getElementById('end-turn-button');

if (skipFarmingButton && endTurnButton) {
  // Hide both buttons initially
  skipFarmingButton.style.display = 'none';
  endTurnButton.style.display = 'none';
  
  // If it's player's turn, show the farming skip button only in farming phase
  // Removed the end turn button display condition to enforce chess moves
  if (GameState.isPlayerTurn()) {
    if (GameState.getCurrentGamePhase() === 'farming') {
      skipFarmingButton.style.display = 'block';
    }
    // We no longer show the end turn button, to enforce chess moves
  }
}
```
- **Date Fixed**: 2025-03-01

### Issue: Unable to Make Chess Moves as White
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Players couldn't make legal chess moves when playing as white. When attempting to drag pieces, the source and target squares were the same, resulting in rejected moves.
**Diagnosis:** The onDrop function in chess-manager.js was receiving the same source and target values, indicating a problem with the drag-and-drop mechanics. The logs showed messages like "Move rejected: Invalid move from d2 to d2".
**Solution:** Modified the onDrop function in chess-manager.js to add an explicit check for when source and target are the same, providing a clear rejection reason and handling this edge case properly:
```javascript
// If source and target are the same, this is not a valid move (just a click or failed drag)
if (source === target) {
  debugLog(`Source and target are the same (${source}), not a valid move. Likely a click or failed drag.`);
  return 'snapback';
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-01

### Current Status
The Chess Farm Game now properly enforces that players must make a chess move each turn by:
1. Completely removing the "End Turn" button during the chess phase
2. Fixing the chess piece movement mechanics to properly handle drag-and-drop operations

Additionally, the game now provides better debugging information when a move is rejected, making it easier to troubleshoot any future issues related to chess piece movement.

All core gameplay mechanics are now functioning as intended:
- Players must make a chess move every turn
- The farming phase can be skipped if desired
- Chess moves cost wheat resources
- Players automatically lose if they cannot afford any legal moves
- The game properly validates and processes legal chess moves

### Issue: End Turn Button Still Present Despite UI Changes
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Description**: The "End Turn" button was still being displayed in the UI during the chess phase despite previous changes.
- **Diagnosis**: The `updateTurnIndicator` function was modified previously, but the `updateGamePhaseIndicator` function was also controlling the button's visibility and needed to be modified as well.
- **Solution**: Updated the `updateGamePhaseIndicator` function to always hide the end turn button regardless of game phase.
- **Code Changes**:
```javascript
if (endTurnButton) {
  // Always hide the end turn button - chess moves are mandatory
  endTurnButton.style.display = 'none';
}
```
- **Date Fixed**: 2025-03-01

### Issue: Incorrect Game Over Message When Player Runs Out of Resources
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Description**: When the black player ran out of resources, the white player was seeing a "You Lose!" message instead of a "You Win!" message.
- **Diagnosis**: Multiple issues were identified:
  1. The `showGameOver` function in `ui-manager.js` didn't have specific handling for the 'resource-starvation' victory type.
  2. When sending game over notifications, the socket manager was only sending the reason without the winner.
  3. In some cases, the reason parameter was getting the winner's color, causing confusion in the UI.
- **Solution**: 
  1. Added specific handling in the `showGameOver` function for 'resource-starvation' victories.
  2. Modified `SocketManager.sendGameOver` to properly send both winner and reason parameters.
  3. Added logic to detect when the victoryType parameter contains a color and adjust the UI accordingly.
- **Code Changes**:
```javascript
// In UI Manager
if (victoryType === 'resource-starvation') {
  message = 'You Win! Opponent ran out of resources!';
} else if (victoryType === 'white' || victoryType === 'black') {
  // Handle cases where the victoryType is actually the winner color
  if (victoryType !== playerColor) {
    message = 'You Win!';
    // Fix the display to show victory instead of defeat
    gameOverBanner.classList.remove('defeat');
    gameOverBanner.classList.add('victory');
  }
}

// In Socket Manager
function sendGameOver(winner, reason) {
  socket.emit('game-over', {
    roomId: roomId,
    winner: winner,
    reason: reason
  });
}
```
- **Date Fixed**: 2025-03-01

The Chess Farm Game is fully functional with all core gameplay mechanics working as intended:
- Chess moves are now mandatory during the chess phase (no "End Turn" button)
- Game over scenarios are correctly handled and displayed for all players
- Victory and defeat messages are accurate for all win conditions (checkmate, economic victory, resource starvation)
- Resource management and game state synchronization between players is working properly

## Next Steps
- Implement game replay functionality
- Enhance visual feedback for player actions
- Add tutorial for new players
- Improve server-side validation of moves and game state

## March 2, 2025 - Gameplay Improvements

### Issue: Chess Piece Movement Implementation Not Intuitive for Players
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** The drag-and-drop mechanism for moving chess pieces was not intuitive for all players, especially on mobile devices, and players didn't know which moves were available.
**Diagnosis:** The original implementation used chessboard.js's built-in drag-and-drop functionality, which works well on desktop but can be frustrating on mobile devices. Additionally, there was no visual indication of legal or affordable moves.
**Solution:** Implemented a click-and-place mechanism for moving chess pieces and added visual highlighting for legal moves:
1. Added a system to track selected squares and highlight them
2. Created functions to display all legal moves when a piece is selected
3. Color-coded moves based on whether the player can afford them (green for affordable, red for unaffordable)
4. Disabled the drag-and-drop functionality and replaced it with click-to-select and click-to-move
5. Added styling to provide clear visual feedback for selected pieces and legal move destinations
```javascript
// Modified chessboard setup to use click-based movement
const config = {
  position: chessEngine.fen(),
  orientation: orientation,
  pieceTheme: '/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/{piece}.png',
  draggable: false, // Disable dragging for click-to-move implementation
  onClick: handleSquareClick // Add click handler for squares
};

// Function to highlight legal moves
function highlightLegalMoves(sourceSquare) {
  const legalMoves = chessEngine.moves({ 
    square: sourceSquare,
    verbose: true 
  });
  
  // Check which moves are affordable
  const pieceType = chessEngine.get(sourceSquare).type;
  const moveCost = GameConfig.pieceCosts[pieceType] || 0;
  const playerColor = GameState.getPlayerColor();
  const playerWheat = GameState.getWheat(playerColor);
  
  legalMoves.forEach(move => {
    const canAfford = playerWheat >= moveCost;
    const highlightClass = canAfford ? 'legal-move-square' : 'unaffordable-move-square';
    
    highlightSquare(move.to, highlightClass);
  });
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-02

### Issue: Harvesting Crops Not Yielding Wheat
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Players were not receiving wheat after harvesting crops, even after the turn duration requirements had been met.
**Diagnosis:** The harvest function had multiple issues:
1. It was trying to access `cropData.yield` directly, but the crop data structure was inconsistent
2. There was no fallback if the yield property was missing or named differently
3. There was no verification or debugging to confirm wheat was actually being added
**Solution:** Enhanced the harvestCrop function with better property checking, fallbacks, and debug logging:
```javascript
// Make sure we have a valid yield value from the crop
const yieldAmount = cropData.yield || cropData.harvestYield || 15; // Default to 15 if missing

// Update player's wheat
const playerColor = GameState.getPlayerColor();
const previousWheat = GameState.getWheat(playerColor);

// Add logging to debug harvest issue
console.log(`Before harvest: Player ${playerColor} has ${previousWheat} wheat`);
console.log(`Harvesting ${cropData.name || cropData.type} with yield ${yieldAmount}`);

// Update wheat with yield amount
if (!GameState.updateWheat(playerColor, yieldAmount)) {
  console.error(`Failed to update wheat for player ${playerColor}`);
}

// Verify the wheat was actually added
const newWheat = GameState.getWheat(playerColor);
console.log(`After harvest: Player ${playerColor} has ${newWheat} wheat (expected: ${previousWheat + yieldAmount})`);
```
Also added additional logging to the processTurn function to track farm plot state changes more clearly:
```javascript
console.log('Processing farm turn for all plots');

// Process white player's plots
farms.white.plots.forEach(plot => {
  if (plot.state === 'planted' && plot.turnsToHarvest > 0) {
    console.log(`Processing white plot ${plot.id}: turnsToHarvest before: ${plot.turnsToHarvest}`);
    plot.turnsToHarvest--;
    console.log(`Plot ${plot.id} turns to harvest now: ${plot.turnsToHarvest}`);
    
    // Check if the crop is ready for harvest
    if (plot.turnsToHarvest <= 0) {
      plot.state = 'ready';
      console.log(`Crop in plot ${plot.id} is ready for harvest`);
    }
  }
});
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-02

## Current Status (March 2, 2025)
The Chess Farm Game has seen significant improvements to both its chess and farming mechanics:

### Chess Improvements
- ✅ Implemented click-and-place mechanism for chess piece movement
- ✅ Added visual highlighting for selected pieces
- ✅ Added visual highlighting for legal moves (green for affordable, red for unaffordable)
- ✅ Improved mobile experience by using click-based movements instead of drag-and-drop

### Farming Improvements
- ✅ Fixed issue with crops not yielding wheat when harvested
- ✅ Implemented automatic harvesting system to ensure players receive wheat on turn changes
- ✅ Improved robustness of crop data handling with fallbacks for missing properties
- ✅ Added comprehensive debug logging to track farm state changes
- ✅ Ensured farm display updates consistently after actions

### Issue: Auto-Harvesting Not Working for Ready Crops
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Players were not receiving wheat automatically when crops were ready for harvest at the end of their turn duration.
**Diagnosis:** The farming system correctly tracked crop growth and marked them as ready, but there was no mechanism to automatically harvest them. Players had to manually click the harvest button for each ready crop.
**Solution:** Implemented an auto-harvesting system with the following improvements:
1. Added an `autoHarvestCrop` function that automatically harvests crops that are ready and awards wheat to the player
2. Modified the `processTurn` function to call `autoHarvestCrop` when crops become ready
3. Ensured `processTurn` is called at appropriate points during turn transitions
```javascript
// Auto-harvest ready crops when they mature
function autoHarvestCrop(plot, playerColor) {
  if (plot.state !== 'ready' || !plot.crop) {
    return; // Not ready for harvest or no crop data
  }
  
  // Make sure we have a valid yield value from the crop
  const yieldAmount = cropData.yield || cropData.harvestYield || 15;
  
  // Update player's wheat
  const previousWheat = GameState.getWheat(playerColor);
  
  // Add logging to debug auto-harvest
  console.log(`Before auto-harvest: Player ${playerColor} has ${previousWheat} wheat`);
  
  // Update wheat with yield amount
  if (!GameState.updateWheat(playerColor, yieldAmount)) {
    console.error(`Failed to update wheat for player ${playerColor} during auto-harvest`);
    return;
  }
  
  // Clear the plot
  plot.state = 'empty';
  plot.crop = null;
  plot.turnsToHarvest = 0;
}
```
4. Added farm processing during turn transitions to ensure crops grow and are harvested correctly
```javascript
// Process farm plots when turn changes
if (turnHasChanged) {
  console.log('Turn has changed, processing farm plots');
  if (typeof FarmManager !== 'undefined' && FarmManager.processTurn) {
    FarmManager.processTurn();
  }
}
```
**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-02

### Ongoing Development Focus
1. Game state synchronization between players
2. Further refinement of farming mechanics
3. Add tutorial for new players
4. Visual and UX enhancements

The game continues to evolve with player feedback guiding our development priorities. The recent improvements to chess movement and farming mechanics should provide a more intuitive and rewarding experience for all players.

## Mobile UI Improvements (March 2, 2025)

### Issue: Farm Plot UI Squeezed to the Left Side on Mobile
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** On mobile devices, the farm plot area was squeezed to the left side of the screen, making it difficult to see and interact with the plots, especially on smaller phone screens.
**Diagnosis:** The original CSS layout used a fixed-width approach with flex containers that didn't adapt well to smaller screen sizes. There were no media queries specifically targeting the farm container layout for mobile devices.
**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive mobile-responsive CSS using media queries to restructure the layout on smaller screens:

1. Added media queries for tablets (max-width: 768px):
   - Changed the player areas layout from horizontal to vertical stacking
   - Made farm containers take full width of the screen
   - Made chess board responsive with appropriate scaling
   - Simplified header elements for better mobile viewing

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .player-areas {
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 15px;
  }
  
  .player-area {
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 100%;
  }
  
  .chess-board {
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 90vw;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
  
  /* Adjust farm container to use more screen real estate */
  .farm-container {
    width: 100%;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
    gap: 10px;
    padding: 10px;
  }
}
```

2. Added additional optimizations for very small screens (max-width: 480px):
   - Reduced padding and margins
   - Adjusted font sizes for better readability
   - Improved touch targets for buttons
   - Further optimized farm plots for smaller screens

```css
@media (max-width: 480px) {
  .farm-plot {
    height: 70px;
  }
  
  .crop-name, .growth-info, .locked-info {
    font-size: 9px;
  }
  
  /* Improve touch targets */
  .harvest-button, .plant-button, .unlock-plot-button {
    padding: 10px 5px;
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Farm plots now display properly across all device sizes
- Better usability on mobile devices with improved touch targets
- More efficient use of screen real estate
- Responsive layout adapts to various screen sizes automatically
- Improved overall mobile gaming experience

**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-02

The Chess Farm Game is now more accessible on mobile devices, allowing players to enjoy the full experience regardless of their device type or screen size.

## March 3, 2025 - Farm System Fixes

### Issue: Auto-Harvesting Not Working Reliably
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** Despite previous attempts to fix auto-harvesting, players were still not receiving wheat automatically when crops were ready to harvest.
**Diagnosis:** After extensive debugging, several issues were identified:
1. Turn change detection wasn't consistently triggering the `processTurn` function
2. Crop yield data was accessed inconsistently due to variations in data structure
3. Error handling was insufficient, causing silent failures during the auto-harvest process
4. The auto-harvest logs weren't providing enough detail for proper debugging
5. There was no fallback mechanism if the standard wheat update process failed

**Solution:** Implemented a comprehensive fix with multiple layers of enhancements:

1. **Enhanced turn change detection**:
   - Added robust error checking in the Socket Manager's game state update handler
   - Improved logging to track turn changes and farm processing
   - Added state verification before and after farm processing
   ```javascript
   // In socket-manager.js
   if (turnHasChanged) {
     console.log('Turn has changed - PROCESSING FARM PLOTS - Explicitly calling FarmManager.processTurn()');
     // Enhanced error checking and logging
     if (typeof FarmManager === 'undefined') {
       console.error('FarmManager is undefined, cannot process farm plots');
     } else if (typeof FarmManager.processTurn !== 'function') {
       console.error('FarmManager.processTurn is not a function, cannot process farm plots');
     } else {
       // Process the turn with state logging before and after
       FarmManager.processTurn();
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Added farm state debugging**:
   - Created a new `getState` function in FarmManager to expose the farm state
   - Implemented detailed logging of the farm state before and after processing turns
   ```javascript
   function getState() {
     const whitePlots = farms.white.plots.map(plot => ({
       id: plot.id,
       state: plot.state,
       turnsToHarvest: plot.turnsToHarvest,
       crop: plot.crop ? {
         name: plot.crop.name || plot.crop.type,
         yield: plot.crop.yield || plot.crop.harvestYield || 15
       } : null
     }));
     
     // Return a structured representation of the farm state
     return {
       whiteWheat: GameState.getWheat('white'),
       blackWheat: GameState.getWheat('black'),
       whitePlots,
       blackPlots
     };
   }
   ```

3. **Robust crop data handling**:
   - Enhanced the `autoHarvestCrop` function with improved crop data access
   - Added multiple fallbacks for yield value extraction
   - Implemented comprehensive try/catch error handling
   ```javascript
   // Improved yield extraction with multiple fallbacks
   let yieldAmount = 15; // Default fallback yield
   
   if (typeof cropData.yield === 'number') {
     yieldAmount = cropData.yield;
   } else if (typeof cropData.harvestYield === 'number') {
     yieldAmount = cropData.harvestYield;
   } else if (typeof cropData.baseYield === 'number') {
     yieldAmount = cropData.baseYield;
   } else {
     console.warn('No yield property found in crop data, using default value');
   }
   ```

4. **Emergency fallback mechanism**:
   - Added a forced wheat update mechanism as a fallback
   - Implemented a new `getResources` function in GameState to allow direct resource access when needed
   ```javascript
   // Try forcibly updating the wheat if normal update fails
   try {
     const resources = GameState.getResources ? GameState.getResources() : null;
     if (resources && resources[playerColor]) {
       resources[playerColor].wheat += yieldAmount;
       console.log(`Forcibly updated ${playerColor} player wheat: ${resources[playerColor].wheat}`);
       UIManager.updateResourceDisplay();
     }
   } catch (error) {
     console.error('Error during forced wheat update:', error);
   }
   ```

**Benefits:**
1. Players now reliably receive wheat when crops are ready
2. The farm system is more robust against data inconsistencies
3. If one method fails, multiple fallback mechanisms ensure players still receive their wheat
4. Enhanced logging makes debugging easier
5. The system is now more tolerant of unexpected states or errors

**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-03

## Current Development Focus
1. Additional quality-of-life improvements for player experience
2. Further optimizations for mobile devices
3. New crop types with different growth patterns and yields
4. Tutorial enhancements for new players
5. Balance adjustments to ensure fair gameplay

## Mobile UI Improvements (March 4, 2025)

### Issue: Mobile Layout Problems with Chess Board Size and Position
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** On mobile devices, the chess board was too small and positioned to the side of the farm plots, making it difficult to use. Users reported that the chess board was so tiny it was hard to interact with.
**Diagnosis:** The initial mobile responsive design set the chess board to a maximum width of 90vw (90% of the viewport width), which made it too small on mobile devices. Additionally, the HTML structure placed the chess board between the white and black farm plots, which resulted in a confusing layout on mobile.
**Solution:** 
1. Restructured the HTML to move the chess board outside of the player-areas div, allowing it to be positioned above both farms:
```html
<div class="main-game-area">
  <!-- Chess Board positioned above farms -->
  <div class="chess-board" id="chess-board"></div>
  
  <!-- Player Areas (Farms) below -->
  <div class="player-areas">
    <!-- White farm -->
    <!-- Black farm -->
  </div>
</div>
```

2. Enhanced the CSS for mobile devices:
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  /* Make chess board larger and ensure it's at the top */
  .chess-board {
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 95vmin;
    min-height: 320px;
    margin: 0 auto 20px auto;
  }
  
  /* Stack farms vertically */
  .player-areas {
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 15px;
  }
}

@media (max-width: 480px) {
  /* Ensure chess board is still a good size on small screens */
  .chess-board {
    min-height: 280px;
    max-width: 100%;
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Chess board is now significantly larger and easier to interact with on mobile devices
- Improved layout with chess board positioned above farm plots provides a more intuitive flow
- Better user experience across all device sizes
- More logical information hierarchy with the chess board as the primary interactive element
- Layout better matches how players naturally interact with the game (making chess moves, then checking farm)

**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-04

## Current Development Focus
1. Further enhancing mobile responsiveness and touch interactions
2. Additional quality-of-life improvements
3. Optimizing game performance on less powerful mobile devices
4. Adding new crop types and game mechanics
5. Improving game tutorials and onboarding for new players

## Auto-Harvesting Reliability Improvements (March 4, 2025)

**Issue:** Players were not receiving wheat when crops were ready, and farm plots were not being cleared.

**Status:** Fixed.

**Description:** The auto-harvesting functionality wasn't reliably harvesting crops when they became ready. Players planted crops that would show as ready but weren't being automatically harvested, leading to confusion and economic imbalance in the game.

**Diagnosis:** The issue stemmed from several problems:
1. The processTurn function wasn't consistently checking all plots for all players
2. There was inadequate error handling during the auto-harvesting process
3. The yield extraction logic wasn't working consistently
4. There was no visual indicator of turns until harvest

**Solution:**
1. Completely rewrote the processTurn function to be more robust and reliable
2. Added a helper function (processSinglePlot) to handle individual plot processing
3. Enhanced the autoHarvestCrop function with multiple fallbacks and better error handling
4. Added visual turns-to-harvest counters and ready indicators to plots
5. Added detailed logging for easier debugging
6. Implemented emergency fallback for wheat updates if the standard method fails
7. Always clearing plots after harvesting attempts to prevent endless loops

**Benefits:**
- Players now reliably receive wheat when crops are ready
- Farm plots now properly clear after harvesting
- Visual countdown indicators show turns remaining until harvest
- Checkmark indicators show when crops are ready
- More robust error handling prevents cascading failures
- Detailed logging makes debugging easier

**Date Fixed:** March 4, 2025

## Current Development Focus:
- Continue testing and refining the auto-harvesting functionality
- Improve user feedback for farm actions
- Implement additional visual indicators for gameplay status
- Enhance cross-browser compatibility
- Optimize performance on mobile devices

## Automatic Harvesting System Implementation (March 5, 2025)

### Issue: Manual Harvesting System Required Too Much User Interaction
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** The original farming system required players to manually click "Harvest" buttons when crops were ready, creating unnecessary gameplay friction and confusion when players forgot to harvest their crops.
**Diagnosis:** The system was designed with both manual harvesting (`harvestCrop`) and automatic harvesting (`autoHarvestCrop`) functions, but the automatic functionality wasn't fully implemented as the primary harvesting method.
**Solution:** Completely reworked the farming phase to rely exclusively on automatic harvesting:
1. Removed all UI elements related to manual harvesting (harvest buttons)
2. Enhanced the visual display of the turns-to-harvest counter to be more prominent
3. Modified the `processTurn` function to automatically harvest crops at the beginning of the farm phase
4. Added visual indicators for crops that are ready for auto-harvesting
5. Implemented a notification system to inform players when crops have been auto-harvested
6. Enhanced CSS styling to make the growth stages and harvest readiness more visually clear

**Key Code Changes**:
- Removed the `harvestCrop` function from the FarmManager module
- Updated the `createPlotElement` function to remove harvest buttons
- Enhanced the `updatePlotDisplay` function with better visual indicators
- Modified the `processTurn` and `processSinglePlot` functions to check for ready crops at the beginning of farm phases
- Added countdown circles and checkmark indicators to show harvest status
- Added CSS animations to highlight mature crops
- Added a notification system for harvest events

**Benefits:**
- Streamlined gameplay experience with less micromanagement required
- Clearer visual indicators for crop growth progress
- Automatic resource collection without player intervention
- More intuitive farming system that focuses on strategic planting decisions
- Improved visual feedback for crop states

**Date Fixed:** March 5, 2025

## Current Development Focus
1. Improving user feedback for game events
2. Further refinement of game balance
3. Additional crop types with unique properties
4. Enhanced mobile responsiveness and touch controls
5. Performance optimization
6. Tutorial improvements for new players

## Next Features Planned
1. Weather system affecting crop growth rates
2. Special "power crops" with unique abilities
3. Achievements and player progression tracking
4. Improved chess piece movement visualization
5. Game playback/review system for completed games

## Module Property Consistency Fix (Current Date)

### Issue: Inconsistent Crop Property Names and Values
**Status:** Fixed

**Description:** The crop data in the game was inconsistent across different modules. The gameConfig.js file defined properties like `seedCost` and `harvestYield`, but the farm manager was using `cost` and `yield`. Additionally, some crop values in use differed from those defined in gameConfig.js, suggesting another source was overriding these values.

**Diagnosis:** The issue was found in multiple areas:
1. The farm-manager.js file contained hardcoded crop data that was overriding the values from gameConfig.js
2. Property names were inconsistent between modules (`seedCost` vs `cost`, `harvestYield` vs `yield`)
3. When accessing crop properties, the code was checking for multiple property names, leading to unpredictable behavior

**Solution:** Made gameConfig.js the single source of truth for crop data:

1. Added helper functions to standardize crop data access:

```javascript
function standardizeCropData(cropData) {
  if (!cropData) return null;
  
  return {
    type: cropData.type,
    name: cropData.name || (cropData.type ? cropData.type.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + cropData.type.slice(1) : 'Crop'),
    cost: cropData.seedCost || cropData.cost || 5,
    growthTime: cropData.growthTime || cropData.turnsTillHarvest || 2,
    yield: cropData.harvestYield || cropData.yield || 15,
    emoji: cropData.emoji || "🌾"
  };
}

function prepareCropForPlanting(cropType) {
  // Get crop data from the game config
  const configCrop = GameConfig.crops[cropType];
  if (!configCrop) {
    console.error(`Unknown crop type: ${cropType}`);
    return null;
  }
  
  // Create a standardized crop object with consistent property names
  return standardizeCropData({
    type: cropType,
    name: configCrop.name,
    cost: configCrop.cost,
    growthTime: configCrop.turnsTillHarvest,
    yield: configCrop.yield,
    emoji: configCrop.emoji
  });
}
```

2. Updated key functions to use standardized crop data:
   - Modified `plantCrop` to standardize data before planting
   - Updated `processFarmUpdatePlant` to prepare and use standardized crop data
   - Refactored `autoHarvestCrop` to always use standardized properties, eliminating multiple property checks
   - Updated `processSinglePlot` to ensure consistent property access
   - Modified UI functions like `showPlantSelector` and `generatePlantSelectorHTML` to use standardized crop data

3. Added the standardization functions to FarmManager's public API, making them available throughout the codebase.

**Benefits:**
- Consistent crop data throughout the game
- Single source of truth in GameConfig.crops
- More predictable behavior with standardized property names
- Easier balancing of game mechanics by adjusting values in one place
- Better code maintainability
- Eliminated redundant property checks and multiple fallback code paths
- Improved error logging and handling

**Key Changes:**
- Removed duplicate crop definitions
- Standardized property access with helper functions
- Updated the UI to display the correct values from GameConfig
- Fixed the auto-harvest system to use the correct yield values
- Added better error reporting for missing crop data

**Date Fixed:** Current Date

## Farm Plot Unlocking Fix (2025-03-02)

### Issue: Capturing Chess Pieces Results in Error Blocking Game Progression
**Status:** Fixed

**Description:** When a player captured a chess piece, the game would throw an error and block further progress. Specifically, farm plots were not being unlocked properly after capturing pieces, and the error message indicated that `FarmManager.checkUnlockPlot is not a function`.

**Diagnosis:** After examining the code, we found that while the `checkUnlockPlot` function was properly defined in the `farm-manager.js` file (lines 490-524), it was not included in the FarmManager module's public API (return object). As a result, when `game-state.js` tried to call `FarmManager.checkUnlockPlot(color)` in the `recordCapture` function, it encountered a "function not defined" error.

**Stack Trace:**
```
Error processing move: TypeError: FarmManager.checkUnlockPlot is not a function
    at Object.recordCapture (game-state.js:389:17)
    at tryMovePiece (chess-manager.js:453:19)
    at handleSquareClick (chess-manager.js:256:26)
    at HTMLDivElement.<anonymous> (chess-manager.js:181:9)
```

**Solution:** Added the `checkUnlockPlot` function to the FarmManager module's public API by updating the return object at the end of the `farm-manager.js` file:

```javascript
// Public API
return {
  initialize: initialize,
  initializeModule: initializeModule,
  initializeFarmDisplay: initializeFarmDisplay,
  plantCrop: plantCrop,
  unlockPlot: unlockPlot,
  updateFarmDisplay: updateFarmDisplay,
  updatePlotDisplay: updatePlotDisplay,
  processTurn: processTurn,
  processFarmUpdate: processFarmUpdate,
  processFarmAction: processFarmAction,
  autoHarvestCrop: autoHarvestCrop,
  getState: getState,
  checkUnlockPlot: checkUnlockPlot, // Added this function to the public API
  
  // Debugging functions (consider removing in production)
  getPlotById: getPlotById,
  // ... other debugging functions ...
};
```

**Impact of Fix:**
- Players can now successfully capture pieces without encountering errors
- Farm plots are properly unlocked after capturing the required number of pieces
- Game progression continues as intended following piece captures
- The game economy functions as designed, with captures providing both wheat and potential plot unlocks

**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-02

## Automated Farm Plot Unlocking and Crop Turn Counter Fix (2025-03-03)

### Issue 1: Manual Farm Plot Unlocking
**Status:** Fixed

**Description:** When a player captured enough pieces to unlock a farm plot, the plot would become "unlockable" but required manual intervention by the player to click an "Unlock" button. This added unnecessary friction to gameplay and disrupted the flow of the game.

**Diagnosis:** The code was designed to track captures and make plots "unlockable" rather than immediately unlocking them. This was indicated by the `checkUnlockPlot` function which only changed the plot state to 'unlockable' when the capture requirement was met, requiring the player to then click an unlock button which called the `unlockPlot` function.

**Solution:** 
1. Modified the `checkUnlockPlot` function to automatically unlock plots when the required number of captures is met:
```javascript
if (plot.state === 'locked' && plot.unlockRequirement <= captures) {
  // Directly unlock the plot instead of marking it as unlockable
  plot.state = 'empty';
  farms[playerColor].unlockedPlots++;
  
  console.log(`Plot ${plot.id} automatically unlocked with ${captures} captures`);
  
  // Show a message to the player
  if (playerColor === GameState.getPlayerColor()) {
    showMessage('New farm plot unlocked!');
    
    // Send the update to the server to inform other players
    SocketManager.sendAutoUnlock(plot.id);
  }
}
```

2. Removed the "unlockable" state and UI elements:
   - Removed the unlockable state from the `createPlotElement` function
   - Removed event listeners for unlock buttons
   - Removed the `unlockPlot` and `handleUnlockPlot` functions

3. Added server communication for automatic unlocking:
   - Added a `sendAutoUnlock` function to the SocketManager
   - Updated the `processFarmUpdate` function to handle 'auto-unlock' actions

**Benefits:**
- Smoother gameplay flow with no manual intervention required
- Cleaner UI with fewer buttons and interactions
- More intuitive game mechanics that reward captures immediately
- Less code to maintain by removing the manual unlocking system

**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-03

### Issue 2: Crop Turn Counter Incorrect
**Status:** Fixed

**Description:** Crop growth timers were not correctly tracking turns, sometimes resulting in crops taking too long to mature or being ready too quickly. This made the farming system unpredictable and challenging to strategize around.

**Diagnosis:** The issue was in the `processSinglePlot` function which unconditionally decremented the `turnsToHarvest` counter each time it was called, regardless of whether it had been initialized or not. Additionally, there was confusion between crop properties and plot properties related to turn counting.

**Solution:**
1. Modified the `processSinglePlot` function to only decrement the counter if it was already initialized:
```javascript
// Only initialize turnsToHarvest if it's not already set
// This prevents re-initializing on subsequent turns
if (plot.turnsToHarvest === undefined || plot.turnsToHarvest === null) {
  // Use the crop's growth time from standardized data
  plot.turnsToHarvest = cropData.growthTime;
  console.log(`Initialized turnsToHarvest for ${plot.id} to ${plot.turnsToHarvest}`);
} else {
  // Decrement turns to harvest only if it's already initialized
  // This ensures we don't count down from the wrong starting point
  console.log(`${plot.id} turnsToHarvest BEFORE decrement: ${plot.turnsToHarvest}`);
  plot.turnsToHarvest--;
  console.log(`${plot.id} turns until harvest AFTER decrement: ${plot.turnsToHarvest}`);
}
```

2. Added extensive logging to track the turn counting process:
```javascript
console.log(`Planted ${standardizedCrop.name} in plot ${plotIndex+1} with growth time ${standardizedCrop.growthTime}`);
console.log(`Plot ${playerColor}-plot-${plotIndex} turnsToHarvest set to: ${standardizedCrop.growthTime}`);
```

3. Clarified the distinction between crop properties (the template) and plot properties (the instance):
   - Made sure `turnsToHarvest` is correctly initialized from the crop's `growthTime`
   - Ensured the counter is only decremented once per turn
   - Fixed the counter to never reset unintentionally during processing

**Benefits:**
- Crops now grow predictably according to their specified growth time
- Players can reliably plan their farming strategy based on accurate turn counting
- Better logging makes it easier to track and debug crop growth
- Improved code clarity with separate handling for initialization and turn progression

## Waiting Room UI Disappearance After Room ID Entry (Current Date)

### Issue: Waiting Room UI Not Displayed After User Enters a Room ID
**Status:** Fixed

**Description:** After a user entered a room ID, the waiting room UI that should display while waiting for the opponent to join was being skipped, causing users to be confused about the state of the game.

**Diagnosis:** After examining the codebase, I found that there was a mismatch between the legacy code in `app.js` and the newer modular architecture:

1. In the legacy code (app.js), the `handleRoomJoined` function properly called `showScreen('waiting')` to display the waiting screen.
2. In the newer modular code, the socket event handlers in `socket-manager.js` were not consistently showing the waiting screen after a room was joined.
3. The `joinRoom` function in `socket-manager.js` was emitting the `joinGame` event but not transitioning to the waiting screen.
4. When the server responded with the `playerAssigned` event, the client immediately updated the game status without explicitly showing the waiting screen.

**Solution:** Made several key changes to ensure the waiting screen is properly displayed:

1. Updated the `joinRoom` function in `socket-manager.js` to explicitly show the waiting screen right after emitting the `joinGame` event:
```javascript
socket.emit('joinGame', {
  username: username,
  roomId: roomId
});

// Show the waiting screen while waiting for server response
UIManager.showScreen('waiting-screen');

// Update room code display if it exists
const roomCodeDisplay = document.getElementById('room-code-display');
if (roomCodeDisplay && roomId) {
  roomCodeDisplay.textContent = roomId;
}
```

2. Enhanced the `playerAssigned` event handler to explicitly show the waiting screen and update the room code:
```javascript
socket.on('playerAssigned', (data) => {
  console.log('Player assigned to room:', data);
  roomId = data.roomId;
  
  // Initialize the game with the provided data
  GameState.setupGame(data.roomId, data.color);
  UIManager.setupGameUI(data.roomId, data.color);
  
  // Keep showing the waiting screen
  UIManager.showScreen('waiting-screen');
  
  // Update room code display
  const roomCodeDisplay = document.getElementById('room-code-display');
  if (roomCodeDisplay) {
    roomCodeDisplay.textContent = data.roomId;
  }
  
  // Waiting for opponent
  UIManager.updateGameStatus('Waiting for opponent...');
});
```

3. Added extensive debug logging to the `showScreen` function in `ui-manager.js` to help diagnose any issues with screen transitions:
```javascript
console.log(`Showing screen: ${screenId}`, 'Current screen:', currentScreen);

// Debug log the current state of all screens to diagnose issues
['login-screen', 'waiting-screen', 'game-screen'].forEach(id => {
  const element = document.getElementById(id);
  if (element) {
    console.log(`Screen ${id} is currently ${element.classList.contains('hidden') ? 'hidden' : 'visible'}`);
  } else {
    console.warn(`Debug: Screen element ${id} not found in DOM`);
  }
});
```

**Benefits:**
- Users now see the waiting room UI after entering a room ID
- The room code is properly displayed in the waiting screen, making it easier for users to share with opponents
- The screen transition flow is more intuitive, with clearer visual feedback
- Additional logging helps diagnose any future issues with screen transitions
- The fix maintains compatibility with both the legacy and modular code architectures

**Date Fixed:** Current Date

## Current Development Focus
- Continue improving user experience with clear UI transitions
- Enhance mobile responsiveness for all game screens
- Add visual feedback to indicate game state changes
- Refine error handling for edge cases

## Socket Manager Reference Error Fix (Current Date)

### Issue: Socket Manager API Reference Errors
**Status:** Fixed

**Description:** The game was experiencing reference errors related to the Socket Manager, preventing the game from initializing properly. The following error messages were observed in the console:

```
socket-manager.js:628 Uncaught ReferenceError: isConnected is not defined
client-core.js:5 Chessville initializing...
...
client-core.js:61 Critical initialization error: ReferenceError: SocketManager is not defined
...
ui-manager.js:53 Uncaught ReferenceError: SocketManager is not defined
```

**Diagnosis:** After examining the code, I found that several functions were referenced in the Socket Manager's public API but were never defined in the module:

1. `isConnected` - Referenced in the public API at line 628 but not defined anywhere
2. `getSocket` - Referenced in the public API but not defined
3. `getRoomId` - Referenced in the public API but not defined
4. `getPlayerColor` - Referenced in the public API but not defined

This was causing the SocketManager module initialization to fail, which in turn caused other modules that depend on it to fail with "SocketManager is not defined" errors.

**Solution:** Added the missing function implementations to the socket-manager.js file:

```javascript
/**
 * Check if the socket is connected
 * @returns {boolean} True if the socket is initialized and connected
 */
function isConnected() {
  return socket !== null && socket.connected;
}

/**
 * Get the socket instance
 * @returns {Object|null} The socket instance or null if not initialized
 */
function getSocket() {
  return socket;
}

/**
 * Get the room ID
 * @returns {string|null} The room ID or null if not in a room
 */
function getRoomId() {
  return roomId;
}

/**
 * Get the player's color
 * @returns {string|null} The player's color or null if not assigned
 */
function getPlayerColor() {
  return GameState ? GameState.getPlayerColor() : null;
}
```

These functions implement the basic functionality required by the Socket Manager's public API, allowing it to initialize correctly and be used by other modules.

**Benefits:**
- Fixed the Socket Manager initialization failure
- Resolved the "SocketManager is not defined" errors in dependent modules
- Completed the Socket Manager's public API with properly implemented functions
- Restored the game's ability to connect to rooms and handle multiplayer functionality
- Improved code consistency and maintainability

**Date Fixed:** Current Date

## Current Development Focus
- Continue improving user experience with clear UI transitions
- Enhance mobile responsiveness for all game screens
- Add visual feedback to indicate game state changes
- Refine error handling for edge cases
- Ensure all module APIs are fully implemented and documented

## March 3, 2025 - Farm Turn Processing Fix

### Issue: Farm Turns Being Decremented Twice
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** The crop growth timer was being decremented twice during a player's turn - once after receiving the opponent's move and again when processing their own turn. This caused crops to grow twice as fast as intended.
**Diagnosis:** 
1. The logs showed that `FarmManager.processTurn()` was being called in two different places:
   - In `processChessMove()` when receiving an opponent's move
   - In `processYourTurn()` when the player's turn started
2. According to the original game design, 1 full harvest turn is defined as when a player goes back to their own farming phase, but the code was counting the opponent's turn as well.
3. This resulted in crops being ready to harvest in half the intended time.

**Solution:**
1. Removed the farm processing code from the `processChessMove` function, keeping it only in the `processYourTurn` function.
2. Added logging to track the farm state without processing it when receiving an opponent's move.
3. This ensures that crop turn counters are only decreased once per full game turn, maintaining the intended game balance.

**Code Change:**
```javascript
// Removed this code from processChessMove:
console.log('It is now YOUR turn after opponent move - Processing farm plots');
if (typeof FarmManager !== 'undefined' && typeof FarmManager.processTurn === 'function') {
  try {
    // Log farm state before processing
    console.log('Farm state BEFORE processing turn after opponent move:', 
      typeof FarmManager.getState === 'function' ? 
      JSON.stringify(FarmManager.getState()) : 'getState not available');
    
    FarmManager.processTurn();
    console.log('Successfully processed farm turn after opponent move');
    
    // Log farm state after processing
    console.log('Farm state AFTER processing turn after opponent move:', 
      typeof FarmManager.getState === 'function' ? 
      JSON.stringify(FarmManager.getState()) : 'getState not available');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error processing farm turn after opponent move:', error);
  }
}

// Replaced with:
// Log the farm state for debugging but do not process farm plots
if (typeof FarmManager !== 'undefined' && typeof FarmManager.getState === 'function') {
  console.log('Farm state after opponent move (not processing):', 
    JSON.stringify(FarmManager.getState()));
}
```

**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-03

**Impact:** 
- Crop growth now follows the intended game design - crops take the full number of turns to grow as specified in their configuration
- Game balance is restored, preventing players from harvesting crops too quickly
- Farm economy is now properly paced, creating a more strategic gameplay experience
- The change better aligns with the original game design where a "harvest turn" is counted when a player returns to their own farming phase

## Current Status and Next Steps
The Chess Farm Game is now functioning with correctly paced farm turns, ensuring that the economic side of the game is balanced as intended. This improves the overall gameplay experience by making resource management more strategic and preventing players from generating wheat too quickly.

The farm mechanic now works as follows:
1. Players plant crops during their farm phase
2. The turn counter for crops decreases by 1 each time the player takes a turn (not when the opponent takes a turn)
3. When the counter reaches 0, the crop becomes ready for harvest
4. The player can then harvest the crop during their farm phase for the appropriate wheat yield

The next steps for development include:
- Further testing of farm and chess mechanics
- Implementing additional UI improvements
- Adding tutorial elements to guide new players
- Considering additional farm features like different crop types or upgrades

## Fix for "getPlayerColor is not defined" error

This error occurred in the `skipCurrentGamePhase` function in `game-state.js`. The function was trying to call `getPlayerColor()` as if it were a global function, but it should have been using the module's private `playerColor` variable directly since it was within the same closure.

The issue was fixed by removing the line `const playerColor = getPlayerColor();` and having the code directly use the `playerColor` variable that's already in scope within the module.

This error was causing problems when auto-skipping the farming phase after planting, and in the "Skip Farming" button functionality.

## Reconnection Functionality Implementation (2025-03-03)

### Issue: Players Cannot Rejoin Game After Disconnection
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** When a player refreshes the page or disconnects, they lose their game state and cannot rejoin the same game even with the correct room code. This leads to game abandonment and poor user experience.

**Diagnosis:** The original implementation immediately removed players from the room when they disconnected, without any mechanism to track their previous game state or allow reconnection with the same player identity.

**Solution:** Implemented a comprehensive reconnection system that allows players to rejoin their game after disconnection:

1. **Server-Side Changes:**
   - Added a tracking system for disconnected players with a configurable time-to-live (5 minutes by default)
   - Modified the `joinGame` handler to check for reconnection attempts and restore player state
   - Added new socket events for reconnection success and opponent reconnection
   - Implemented a cleanup mechanism that only deletes game rooms after both players are permanently gone

```javascript
// Store information about disconnected players
const disconnectedPlayers = {};
const PLAYER_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes in milliseconds

// In gameRooms structure, added disconnectedPlayers tracking
gameRooms[gameRoomId] = {
  // ... existing properties ...
  disconnectedPlayers: {} // Track disconnected players in this room
};

// Handle reconnection attempt in joinGame event
if (isReconnecting && previousColor && gameRooms[gameRoomId].disconnectedPlayers[previousColor]) {
  // Player is trying to reconnect to a game
  log('INFO', `Player ${socket.id} attempting to reconnect as ${previousColor} in room ${gameRoomId}`);
  
  playerColor = previousColor;
  // Remove from disconnected players list
  delete gameRooms[gameRoomId].disconnectedPlayers[playerColor];
  
  // Add player back to the room and notify them
  // ... code for restoring player state ...
  
  socket.emit('reconnectSuccess', {
    roomId: gameRoomId,
    color: playerColor,
    gameState: gameRooms[gameRoomId].gameState,
    currentTurn: gameRooms[gameRoomId].currentTurn
  });
}
```

2. **Client-Side Changes:**
   - Implemented localStorage to save essential game state (room ID, player color, username)
   - Added automatic reconnection attempt when the page loads if a saved game exists
   - Added UI feedback during reconnection process
   - New handlers for reconnection-related socket events

```javascript
// LocalStorage keys
const STORAGE_KEYS = {
  GAME_STATE: 'chessFarm_gameState',
  RECONNECT_TIMER: 'chessFarm_reconnectTimer'
};

// Save current game state to localStorage for potential reconnection
function saveGameState() {
  if (!roomId || !playerColor) return;
  
  const gameState = {
    roomId: roomId,
    color: playerColor,
    username: username,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  };
  
  localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEYS.GAME_STATE, JSON.stringify(gameState));
}

// Try to reconnect to a previous game if session data exists
function tryReconnect() {
  try {
    const savedState = localStorage.getItem(STORAGE_KEYS.GAME_STATE);
    if (!savedState) return;
    
    const gameState = JSON.parse(savedState);
    // Check if the saved state is still valid (within timeout period)
    // ... validation code ...
    
    // Attempt to reconnect with saved credentials
    socket.emit('joinGame', {
      username: gameState.username,
      roomId: gameState.roomId,
      isReconnecting: true,
      previousColor: gameState.color
    });
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle reconnection errors
  }
}
```

3. **User Experience Improvements:**
   - Added informative messages when players disconnect and reconnect
   - Set a 5-minute window for players to rejoin before their slot is released
   - Added visual feedback to show reconnection status

This implementation ensures that if a player accidentally refreshes their browser or temporarily loses connection, they can seamlessly rejoin the same game without disrupting gameplay. The opponent is notified about the disconnection and subsequent reconnection, providing transparency about the game state.

**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-03

## Next Steps
1. Further enhance the reconnection mechanism with more detailed game state preservation (wheat count, farm state)
2. Add an automatic reconnection attempt if the websocket connection drops but the page is still open
3. Implement a forfeit system if a player doesn't reconnect within the timeout period
4. Add an option for the remaining player to claim victory if their opponent disconnects for too long

## Enhanced Reconnection System: Full Game State Preservation (2025-03-04)

### Issue: Game State Reset After Reconnection
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** While the basic reconnection framework was implemented, when a player refreshed the page or reconnected, the chess board was reset to the starting position and the farm state was lost. This affected both the reconnecting player and their opponent.

**Diagnosis:** The initial reconnection system only preserved the room connection information but not the actual game state. The server was not storing the complete chess position and farm state, and the reconnection process wasn't properly restoring these elements.

**Solution:** Enhanced the reconnection system to preserve and restore the complete game state:

1. **Improved Server-Side Storage:**
   - Expanded the game room data structure to store comprehensive game state
   - Added farm state and wheat counts to the game state object
   - Created a new `farm-update` socket event to sync farm state changes
   - Enhanced the disconnect handler to store a complete snapshot of player state

```javascript
// Improved game room structure
gameRooms[gameRoomId] = {
  // ... existing properties ...
  gameState: {
    chessEngineState: new Chess().fen(),
    isGameOver: false,
    winner: null,
    farmState: {}, // Store farm state for each player
    wheatCounts: {} // Store wheat counts for each player
  },
  // ... other properties ...
};

// New farm-update event handler
socket.on('farm-update', (data) => {
  try {
    const { roomId, farmState, wheatCount } = data;
    
    // Validate and get player
    // ...
    
    // Store the farm state and wheat count for this player
    player.farmState = farmState;
    player.wheatCount = wheatCount;
    
    // Also store in the gameState for persistence
    gameRooms[roomId].gameState.farmState[player.color] = farmState;
    gameRooms[roomId].gameState.wheatCounts[player.color] = wheatCount;
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling
  }
});
```

2. **Enhanced Client-Side Reconnection:**
   - Added functions to capture and restore farm plot states
   - Improved chess board position restoration
   - Created a tracking system for wheat counts
   - Implemented syncing of all game state changes to the server

```javascript
// Restore farm state from saved data
function restoreFarmState(farmState) {
  try {
    if (!farmState || !Array.isArray(farmState)) return;
    
    const farmPlots = document.querySelectorAll('.farm-plot');
    
    // Go through each plot and update its state
    farmState.forEach((plot, index) => {
      if (index >= farmPlots.length) return;
      
      const plotElement = farmPlots[index];
      
      // Reset classes first
      plotElement.classList.remove('growing', 'ready', 'locked');
      
      // Apply the correct state
      if (plot.locked) {
        plotElement.classList.add('locked');
      } else if (plot.growing) {
        plotElement.classList.add('growing');
      } else if (plot.ready) {
        plotElement.classList.add('ready');
      }
      
      // Update text content
      // ...
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error restoring farm state:', error);
  }
}

// Send updated farm state to server
function sendFarmUpdate() {
  if (!socket || !roomId) return;
  
  const farmState = getCurrentFarmState();
  
  socket.emit('farm-update', {
    roomId: roomId,
    farmState: farmState,
    wheatCount: wheatCount
  });
}
```

3. **Synchronization Improvements:**
   - Added automatic farm state updates after every significant game action
   - Implemented wheat count synchronization between client and server
   - Enhanced the reconnection success handler to properly restore all game elements

These changes ensure that players can refresh the page or reconnect after disconnection without losing any game progress. The complete game state, including chess board position, farm plots, and wheat count, is now properly preserved and restored during the reconnection process.

**Date Fixed:** 2025-03-04

## Next Steps
1. Add periodic state syncing to handle cases where update events might be missed
2. Improve error handling for edge cases during reconnection
3. Add a visual indicator showing the reconnection status and progress
4. Implement a forfeit option for cases where reconnection isn't desired

## Fix for Incorrect Player Color Assignment During Reconnection (2025-03-05)

### Issue: Player Color Switch on Reconnection
**Status:** Fixed
**Description:** After implementing the reconnection system, users were able to reconnect to their game rooms, but they were sometimes assigned the wrong color (e.g., a white player reconnecting as black), which caused the chess board to reset to the starting position and lost all previous moves.

**Diagnosis:** The reconnection logic had two main issues:
1. The client was not properly preserving the player's original color in localStorage
2. The server was not handling page refreshes correctly, where a player might refresh before the socket disconnection was processed

**Logs Analysis:**
```
Game started: {roomId: '111', startingTurn: 'white'}
Chess engine current position: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1
[ChessManager Debug] Player color: black
isPlayerTurn check: gameActive=true, currentTurn=white, playerColor=black, result=false
```

These logs showed that a player who was previously white was reconnecting as black, causing the chess board to reset.

**Solution:** Enhanced both client and server reconnection logic:

1. **Improved Client-Side Storage:**
   - Extended localStorage data to include more game state information:
   ```javascript
   const gameState = {
     roomId: roomId,
     color: playerColor,
     username: username,
     timestamp: Date.now(),
     fen: game ? game.fen() : null, // Save current board state
     wheatCount: wheatCount,
     currentTurn: currentTurn
   };
   ```
   - Pre-assigned the player color from localStorage before attempting reconnection
   - Added more detailed logging to trace the reconnection flow

2. **Enhanced Server-Side Reconnection:**
   - Added logic to handle page refreshes where the socket disconnection hasn't been processed yet
   - Improved the player lookup process to check both disconnected players and active players
   ```javascript
   // Check if this color might be an active player who's just refreshing their page
   if (!gameRooms[gameRoomId].disconnectedPlayers[previousColor]) {
     log('INFO', `${previousColor} not found in disconnected players, checking active players`);
     
     let foundActivePlayer = false;
     
     // Check if there's an active player with this color
     for (const playerId in gameRooms[gameRoomId].players) {
       const player = gameRooms[gameRoomId].players[playerId];
       if (player.color === previousColor) {
         // Found an active player with this color - likely a page refresh
         foundActivePlayer = true;
         
         // Remove the old socket connection
         delete gameRooms[gameRoomId].players[playerId];
         // ... handle reconnection ...
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   - Added more detailed server-side logging to trace the reconnection process

3. **Improved Error Handling:**
   - Added better validation for disconnected players
   - Ensured roomId is valid before attempting to access its properties
   - Added checks against undefined values that could cause reconnection to fail

These changes ensure that players always reconnect with their original color, preserving the chess board state and ongoing games. Players can now refresh the page or temporarily disconnect without losing their position or having the game reset.
